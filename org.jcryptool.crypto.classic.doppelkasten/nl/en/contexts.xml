    <description>The Double Box cipher is a digraph substitution technique, which works basically like the well-known Playfair algorithm (replacing each letter pair with another), but introduces several improvements, like double encryption and splitting of plaintext.
&lt;br&gt;The Double box cipher was used by the German forces in World War II and was broken in Bletchley Park until 1944.
