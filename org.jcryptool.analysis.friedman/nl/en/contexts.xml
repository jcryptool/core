      <description>Use the &lt;b&gt;Friedman Test&lt;/b&gt; to find the length of the key used to encrypt a Vigenère-encrypted text.&lt;br&gt;
After analyzing a text with a click on the main button, a graph should appear, which, by expectation, shows recurring peaks with a period of n. Find out n, which is the key length.&lt;br&gt;
It is possible to interact with the graph by zooming (in: left mouse button click; out: right mouse button click) and dragging.</description>
