VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description=Verifiable Secret Sharing is a secret sharing algorithm. The secret is shared in a way,\r\nthat every involved person gets a unique part of the secret. Additionally, every person has the possibility to check if the parts of the other persons are correct.\r\nTo reconstruct the secret, just a certain number, determined in the beginning, of parts of the secret is necessary.\r\nThe secret is reconstructed with the Lagrange-Interpolation.\r\nIf the focus is set on a container, the explanations provided in the box will be displayed.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_error_start=The following conditions have to be fulfilled:

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_player_n_positive=The number of players has to be a natural number!
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_player_n_bigger_2=The number of players has to be at least 2!
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_player_t_smaller_n=The number of players for the reconstruction, mustn't be higher than number of total players!
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_secret_s_positive=The secret s has to be a natural number!
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_module_p_bigger_s=The safe prime p has to be at least twice as big than the secret!
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_module_p_isPrime=A safe prime has to be entered for p!
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_primitive_g=g has to be an element of the order q!
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_set_all=Not all parameters are set! They will now be set to random values.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_param_p_not_safe_prime=The chosen p is not a safe prime! It will now be set to the next higher safe prime.
	
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_coefficient_positive=The coefficients have to be natural numbers!

ChartComposite_reconstruct_success=The polynom was successfully reconstructed.
ChartComposite_reconstruct_failure=The polynom couldn't be reconstructed. Either you have to choose more players for reconstruction or a share was changed.
ChartComposite_noGraph=The first actual graph is shown when you press the reconstruct-button.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_parameters_left=In this step the parameters are chosen.\n\r  \u2022 Number of players n [n \u2208 \u2115; n > 1] (mandatory item)\n\r  \u2022 Number of players for the reconstruction t [t \u2208 \u2115; 1 < t \u2264 n] (mandatory item)\n\r  \u2022 Secret s [s \u2208 \u2115] (mandatory item)\n\r    \u2012 Will be randomly generated if nothing is entered.\n\r    \u2012 Is limited by 2,000,000 caused by long processing duration with higher values.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_parameters_right=  \u2022 Safe Prime p [p \u2208 \u2119; p > 2s] (mandatory item)\n\r    \u2012 Will be generated automatically.\n\r    \u2012 A Safe Prime is a prime number of the form 2q + 1, where q is also a prime. \n\r  \u2022 Generator g [g \u2208 \u2124_p; order(g)  =  q] (mandatory item)\n\r    \u2012 Will be generated automatically.\n\r  \u2022 q [q \u2208 \u2119] (mandatory item)\n\r    \u2012 It is the biggest prime factor of p-1, while q = (p-1)/2.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_coefficients_left=In this step the coefficients a\u1D62 [a\u1D62 \u2208 \u2115; 1 \u2264 a\u1D62 < q] for the polynomial P(x) will be set.\n\rOnly coefficients greater than 0 are allowed because of security-reasons in the algorithm.\n\rThey can be set or randomly generated.\n\ra\u2080 is the secret s. \n\rThe other coefficients a\u2081 to a_(t-1) are set 1 per default.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_coefficients_right=The polynomial P(x) is constructed like this: P(x) = a\u2080 + a\u2081x + a\u2082x\u00B2 + ... + a_(t-1)x^(t-1)\n\rIf all coefficients are set, the polynomial will be displayed\n\rand it is possible to calculate the commitments and shares.\n\rThe calculation of the shares are independent from the calculation of the commitments. \n\rBut keep in mind that the commitments are essential for checking the shares.

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_commitments_left=In this step the commitments Y\u2091 for each coefficient a\u2091 are calculated as followed: \n\r Y\u2091 = g ^ a\u2091 mod p \n\rThey are used for the check of the shares.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_commitments_right

VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_shares_left=In this step the shares for each player i are calculated like this: \n\rN\u1D62 = P(i) mod q \n\rThe value of i is the ID of each player and P(i) is the polynomial. \n\rThe shares are displayed in their origin size, which is used for the visualization of the graph, and modulo q. 
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_shares_right=The check verifies that the share fits to the committed polynomial. \n\rThe check of the shares has to be done for each player seperately. \n\rIf the check has been successfull the share becomes green and if not it becomes red. \n\rThe shares modulo p can be falsified to show a how changed share can influence the reconstruction. \n\rThe calculation is done this way:
	
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_reconstruction_left=In this step the reconstruction of the polynomial will be done.\n\rFor reconstructing the polynomial, you have to choose a number of shares which is bigger or at least equal to to. \n\rThe reconstruction is done with the Lagrange-Interpolation:
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_reconstruction_right=  \u2022 Keep in mind: \n\r    \u2012 u is the number of chosen player and\n\r    \u2012 x_k und x_l are the player IDs.
VerifiableSecretSharingComposite_description_reconstruction_right_part2=The result is the polynomial P'(x).\n\rIf the chosen number of players is enough, P'(x) is P(x) and so the coefficient a\u2080 is the secret s.
