<h1>Playfair Cipher</h1>
<p>
	The Playfair cipher is a well-known monoalphabetic digraph substitution cipher, which was mainly used by the British military in World War I.

<h3 id="algorithm">The en- and decryption algorithm</h3>
<p>A 5x5 matrix (Playfair-matrix) has to be
filled with the plain text alphabet (which means that the plaintext alphabet
must contain 25 characters), e. g. by a key word, which is first filled into
the matrix, and then the other plain text alphabet characters. Then, the plain
text will be split up in pairs, which are substituted with other pairs,
following these rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>If both characters of the pair are in the
same column of the Playfair matrix, replace each with the character below it in
the matrix.</li>

<li>If both characters of the pair are in the
same row of the Playfair matrix, replace each with the character right next to
it it in the matrix.</li>

<li>If both pair characters stand in different
columns and rows in the matrix, replace each of it with the character that
stands in the same row, but in the column of the other pair character. </li>

<li>If a pair consists of similar characters,
separate them with a filling character (“X”)</li>
</ul>

<p>The text „SIMONIEX“ („X“ as filler to make
the text length even) will be encrypted with the key word „ZOELIBAT“. The
playfair matrix is then:</p>

<p>First: splitting the plain text into pairs:
“SI  MO  NI  EX“. Then, substitute, following the rules (see above). E. g., „SI“
is substituted with „YD“, following the first rule. The complete ciphertext is „YD 
GI  SZ  LW“.</p>


<h4>Decryption</h4>

<p>At the decryption, the same Playfair-matrix
is used, but the substitution rules have to be reverted (which is trivial).
Then the ciphertext has to be split up in pars, and substituted with the
inverse rules.</p>
