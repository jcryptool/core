PluginBtnListener_archpic_check_explain=If the receiver of signed data (e.g. an Email) wants to proof the authenticity of that data, he basically needs to take two steps. First, he needs to check whether the signature was really made by the private key corresponding to the certificate. Second, he needs to get the CRL from the issuing CA. If the certificate has been revoked, the signature is only valid, if the signature was created before the certificate had been revoked.
PluginBtnListener_archpic_create_explain=If somebody wishes to proof, that a public key corresponds to a private key in his possession, he can get a certificate. To that purpose, he creates a "certificate signing request" (CSR) including his public key and forwards it to a so-called "registration authority" (RA). In addition, he needs to provide some proof of identity, e.g. a copy of a photo ID. The RA checks if the person trying to get a certificate is really the person he claims to be. If that is the case, the RA forwards the CSR to a "certification authority" (CA). The CA creates a certificate out of the CSR, signs this certificate and returns it to the user. The whole of RA, CA and the involved processes are also called a "public key infrastructure" (PKI).
PluginBtnListener_archpic_revoke_explain=There are a lot of different reasons, why someone might want to revoke a certificate even before it expires. You can read about this reasons in the online help. If a certificate owner wants to revoke his certificate, he has to create a "revocation request" (RR). This RR is sent to the certification authority. The CA manages a "certificate revocation list" (CRL), which is essentially a list of all certificates that have been revoked. If a CA receives a RR, it adds the certificate in question to the CRL.
PluginBtnListener_visual_intro_text=This plug-in shows how a public-key infrastructure (PKI) works. You can create key pairs and certificate signing requests for public keys. Afterwards, you can take a look at each step that your request needs to take through the different parts of the PKI. After the certificate was issued, you can create and check signatures for texts or files. Also, you can revoke your certificate. Every step is accompanied by additional explanations. Further information regarding PKI is given in the online help.
SecondUserListener_msgbox_text_badsig=The signature itself is bad.
SecondUserListener_msgbox_text_revoked=Signature was created after certificate expiration.
SecondUserListener_msgbox_text_signed_before_revoke=The signature is correct. The signature was created, before the certificate has been revoked.
SecondUserListener_msgbox_text_was_not_revoked=The signature is correct. This means that the message was sent by the according owner of the certificate and that the message was not changed after signing.
SecondUserListener_msgbox_text_was_revoked=The signature was created after the certificate has been revoked. 
SecondUserListener_msgbox_title_badsig=Bad Signature
SecondUserListener_msgbox_title_revoked=Certificate revoked
SecondUserListener_msgbox_title_success=Success
SecondUserListener_msgbox_title_was_revoked=Certificate revoked
SigVisPluginOpenListener_enter_text_to_sign=Enter text to sign...
SigVisPluginOpenListener_msgbox_text_signed_msg_was_sent=Your signed message has been sent\! You can verify the message at the "2nd User" tab.
SigVisPluginOpenListener_msgbox_title_success=Hooray
TabItemListener_tab_ca_explain=The "certification authority" (CA) has two responsibilities: On the one hand it issues the certificates to the CSRs it receives from the RA. On the other hand it manages a "certificate revocation list" (CRL). If a certificate owner wants his certificate to be revoked, the CA adds it to the CRL. Certificate revocation, its reasons and consequences are covered in the "User" view. The CA only has to make sure to timely respond to revocation requests and keep its CRL up to date.\n\nAt the left hand side, you can see a list of CSRs and RRs. If you accept a CSR, the certificate in question will be issued and forwarded to the requesting user. You can show and use it afterwards in the "User" role and view. If you accept a RR, the certificate in question will be added to the CRL.\n\nTo get more information about the technical backgrounds, consult the online help.
TabItemListener_tab_ra_explain=The "registration authority" (RA) is the part of a PKI responsible for verifying that a CSR is genuine. With regards to a personal certificate as in this case, the RA has to check if the person trying to get the certificate is the person he claims to be.\n\nAt the left hand side you can see a list of CSRs. If you select one of them, the personal details of the requesting person are shown. You can check the provided proof of identity by clicking "Check identity." After you verified the identity for a CSR, you can either reject it or forward it to the CA.\n\nYou can read more about the responsibilities of a RA in the online help.
TabItemListener_tab_secuser_explain=In this view you can check the signatures you created as the role of the first user. At the left hand side, you can select texts or files. Your selection and the provided signature will be shown in the middle. By clicking "Check signature" you can check the validity of the signature. Be aware though, that no revocation status is checked by default. This is the case, because many applications such as web browsers or email clients don't check for certificate revocation by default. Often, this has to be set by the user manually.\nAlso, be aware that a signature is generally considered valid, as long as the date of the signature is before the date of a certificate's revocation. The revocation only prevents valid signatures from being created after the certificate has been revoked. Read more about the revocation of certificates and the details about signature validation in the online help.
TabItemListener_tab_user_explain=In this view you can request a new certificate, manage your issued certificates or create signatures for texts or files.\n\nChoose one of the actions at the left hand side to get further information. If this is your first time running the plugin, you should start with "Request new certificate."
