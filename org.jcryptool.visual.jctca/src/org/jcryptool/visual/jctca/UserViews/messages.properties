CreateCert_explain_text=With this form you can request a new certificate. You can keep the provided dummy data or fill out your own. In order for the certificate to be issued, you need to provide some proof of your identity. For this plug-in, we assume that a copy of a photo ID is sufficient. A sample photo ID will be provided if you choose none. You can choose an image from your local hard drive if you want to, though. The data you provide will not leave your computer though, all processes are fictional. You can find more about how PKIs check the identity of their users in the online help.\n\nYou can choose an existing public key by selecting "Choose public key." If you don't have a key pair yet, simply select "Generate new key pair before sending" and one will be created for you.\n\nOnce you're finished, you can forward your request to the fictional RA of this plug-in by clicking "Send CSR to RA." Afterwards, proceed to the "Registration Authority" tab to continue.

ShowCert_explain_text=In this view you can take a look at the certificates that have already been issued to you. The fields shown correspond to the X.509 standard for digital certificates. You can see to whom the certificate has been issued. The common name is the first name and last name you provided when you created the CSR. If this was an certificate only for signing emails, the common name could be an email address as well. For webserver certificates, the common name is usually the domain name. Organization and Organizational Unit are not part of the certificate because it wasn't issued for a specific organisation or company. After that, you can find information about the issuing CA. In addition to the information about the certificate holder and the issuer, every certificate has a validity period.\n\nBy clicking "Revoke certificate", you can create a revocation request for your certificate. For this purpose, a new window will be opened. You can find more detailed information about X.509 and certificate revocation in the online help.

SignCert_explain_text=In this view you can create signatures for files on your local hard drive or text input. A signature is created with the private key of a key pair. You can choose one of the private keys, for which public key you've been issued a certificate already. The text you input or the file you choose will be signed with the selected key. The data with its signatures will then be available in the "2nd User" tab for validation.\n\nIf you would like to know about the signature process in more detail, you can check to "Show the signature process vizualised." This will take you to another plugin that deals with the signature process in great detail. All the input and signatures created there will later be available in the "2nd User" tab as well.
