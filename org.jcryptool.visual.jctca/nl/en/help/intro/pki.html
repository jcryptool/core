        <h1>PKI processes</h1>
        <!--first, we give a general introduction about this section of the online-help-->
        <p>
        The plug-in starts with a graphical display of the processes connected with the creation, revocation and usage of a digital certificate.

        <h3>Certificate creation</h3>

        <p>
        If a user wants to get a certificate, he needs to create a certificate signing request (CSR) first. The CSR contains the user's public key and is signed with his private key. He forwards the CSR with some proof of his identity (e.g. a copy of a photo ID) to a so-called registration authority (RA).
        </p>
        <p>
        The RA checks, if the photo ID is genuine and the data contained in it matches the data provided in the CSR. If this isn't the case, the CSR is rejected. If the CSR passes the check, the RA forwards it to the certification authority (CA).
        </p>
        <p>
        The CA is responsible for issuing the requested certificates. It generates a certificate from the CSR, which it signs with its own private key. The final certificate contains the name of the certificate holder, information about the issuer and a validity period. You can read about the formal structure of a certificate in the <a href="../pkix/standards.html">section about X.509 and PKIX</a>. The certificate is then returned to the user.
        </p>

        <h3>Certificate revocation</h3>

        <p>
        A PKI does not only provide the means to create certificates. It also maintains services necessary to revoke a certificate before its validity period ends. The possible reasons for revocation are many. Maybe the private key got stolen or lost. Maybe the certificate holder left the organization specified within the certificate. A CA can revoke certificates by itself as well if it got broken into for example. If a user wants to revoke his certificate, he creates a revocation request (RR) and sings it with his private key. If he can no longer use the private key for whatever reason, the RR needs to be verified by the RA in the same manner the CSR was. If a CA gets a RR either signed by the user himself or checked by the RA, it adds the certificate in question to its so-called "certificate revocation list" (CRL). This CRL is basically a list of all non-expired, revoked certificates.
        </p>
        <h3>Signature check</h3>
        <img alt="Architekturskizze Signaturpr&uuml;fung" src="../media/minica_check.png" />
        <p>
        If somebody receives signed data (e.g. an email), he needs to check for several things to determine if the signature is valid. First, he needs to check if the certificate itself is valid. For that purpose, he needs to get the so-called root certificate of the issuing CA. This root certificate is the certificate corresponding to the private key, with which the CA created the user's certificate. Next, he needs to check if the certificate has not yet expired. In the strictest sense, a signature is never valid if a certificate has expired. Only during the validity period does the CA maintain the revocation status of a certificate. Therefore, one can not determine if a certificate has been revoked or not once it expired. In practice, CAs treat this differently, though. However, this plug-in adheres to the standard and treats every signature from an expired certificate as invalid. If the certificate is valid and not expired, the receiver needs to check if the signature was created by the private key corresponding to the certificate. If that is the case, the revocation status of the certificate has to be checked. To that purpose, the receiver requests the issuing CA's CRL and checks if and when the certificate was added to it. A signature is valid only if: The certificate itself is valid and not expired and the signature is valid (i.e. was created by the private key corresponding to the public key) and the signature was created before the certificate was added to the CRL. Signatures created before a certificate has been revoked remain valid, because otherwise certificate validation would be a way to invalidate contracts signed with the private key corresponding to the revoked certificate. The standards about digital certificates do not cover how signatures of revoked certificates that are technically valid are to be treated. This is left to the parties in question.
