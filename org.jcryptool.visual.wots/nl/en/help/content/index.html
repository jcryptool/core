		<p>This visualization is a demonstration of the Winternitz One-Time Signature (WOTS).</p>
		<p>WOTS is an algorithm to sign digital messages.</br>
		   When using a <b>one-time</b> signature, a pair of keys is used only once to sign a single message.</p>
		
		<p>JCT contains in several plugins a sequence of visualizations of modern PQC signatures (like XMSS and SPHINCS) &ndash; a good and up-to-date overview of such schemes can be found in Wikipedia [1,2]. WOTS in the variant WOTS+ is a component of both, <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.visual.merkletree/$nl$/help/content/index.html">XMSS</a> and <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.visual.sphincs/$nl$/help/content/Sphincs.html">SPHINCS</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="input">1.1) Input fields</h3>
		<p>All "input fields" can be edited. Only the <b>message</b> field has to be filled with text by the user; all other fields are calculated by pressing the buttons <b>Generate signature</b> or <b>Validate signature</b>. The calculated fields continue to be editable in order to show the correctness of the signature validation.</p>

		<ul>
		       <li><b>Message</b> </br>
                A message can either be entered manually or be loaded from a text file.
				Alternatively, the standard message can be used. Any change of the message automatically updates the fields "Message digest" and "b_i" if the button <b>Show details</b> has been pressed.
				</li>
		       <li><b>Message digest</b> </br>
				The content of this field is the calculated hash of the given message.
				</li>
		       <li><b>b_i</b> </br>
				The content of this field is the value of b_i. For further information 
				on how b_i is calculated see chapter <a href="#siggen">Generate signature</a>.
		       </li>
		       <li><b>Keys</b> </br>
				These fields show the calculated keys.
		       </li>
		       <li><b>Signature</b> </br>
				This field contains the signature after it has been calculated.
		       </li>
	       	</ul>

		<p> </br> </p>
		<h3 id="param">1.2) Parameters</h3>
		<ul> 
		       <li><b>Winternitz parameter w</b> </br>
				Determines the level of compression while generating the keys. Possible values are integers 
				greater 1. Using a bigger value for w leads to smaller keys, but also increased runtime.
		       </li>			
		       <li><b>Hash function</b> </br>
				It is possible to switch between three hash functions: SHA-256, SHA-1
		       	and MD5 (SHA-1 and MD5 should not be used in real implementations due to successful collision attacks).
		       </li>			
		       <li><b>WOTS/WOTS+</b> </br>
				It is possible to switch between these two variants. Please note that after this switch the fields "Message", "Keys", and "Signature" will be 
				cleared. For further information about the differences between WOTS and WOTS+ see chapter <a href="#wotsplus">WOTS+</a>.
		       </li>			
	       	</ul>

		<p><b>General information to avoid misuse:</b></br>
	       	Below every editable field, the actual length and the target length of the field are displayed. While editing 
			in any field the actual value will change dynamically, and it changes to red if actual and target value of the field length don't match.</br>
			You may use arbitrary symbols while editing the message field, but all other fields accept only hexadecimal 
			values (0-9 and A-F). If an invalid symbol is entered, the field will change its color to red.</br>
			As long as either invalid symbols are present, or the actual and target values don't match, the possibility 
			to edit other fields is disabled.</p>

		<h3 id="button">1.3) Buttons</h3>
		<ul> 
		       <li><b>Load message from file</b> </br>
			Opens a dialog to choose a file, which is subsequently displayed in the message field.
		       </li>			
		       <li><b>Generate keys</b> </br>
			A valid pair of keys is calculated and displayed in the key fields. For further information on how keys are 
			generated see chapter <a href="#keygen">Key generation</a>.
		       </li>			
		       <li><b>Generate signature</b> </br>
			A valid signature will be generated using the given private key, and displayed in the signature field. For 
			further information on how a signature is 
			generated see the chapter <a href="#siggen">Signature generation</a>.

		       </li>			
		       <li><b>Validate signature</b> </br>
			The given signature will be validated using the public key. If the signature is valid, the signature 
			field will change its color to green. If the signature is invalid the color will change to red.
		       </li>		
		       <li><b>Show/Hide details</b> </br>
			It is possible to enable details such as the fields "Message digest" and "b_i". 
			This is a pure visual feature which has no impact on the actual algorithm.
		       </li>			
		       <li><b>Reset</b> </br>
			Clears the calculated values (key and signature), but doesn't change any other values or parameters. So the message field is left unchanged.
		       </li>			
		       <li><b>Restart</b> </br>
			The plugin will be set back to its original state. In contrast to the <b>Reset</b> button, here also changed  parameters or messages are set back.
		       </li>			
	       	</ul>

		<p>There is a dependency between the buttons "Generate keys", "Generate signature", and "Validate signature" concerning their activation: The button <b>Generate signature</b> is disabled as long as the button <b>Generate keys</b> has not been pushed. 
		The same applies for "Validate signature", which is only activated after a signature has been generated.</p>

		<h4 id="usedParam">2.1.1) Used parameters</h4>
		<ul> 
		       <li><b>n = Size of a block in byte</b> </br>
			       n is determined by the chosen hash function (for instance, SHA-256 creates a 32 byte (256 bit) output, so n is 32).
		       </li>			
		       <li><b>m = Size of the hash value of the message in bit</b></br>
			       The hash value of the message using SHA-256 has a length of 256 bit.
		       </li>			
		       <li><b>t = Number of blocks which form each key</b> </br>
			       This number is calculated in two steps, and it is the sum of their results (t_1 and t_2).
		       </li>			
		       <li><b>t_1 = m/log2(w) = number of base-w elements generated from a message</b> </br>
			       	whereupon the result is rounded up.
		       </li>			
		       <li><b>t_2 = (log2(l_1(w-1))/log2(w))+1 = number of base-w elements generated from the checksum</b> </br>
			       	whereupon the result is rounded down.
		       </li>			
		       <li><b>t = t_1 + t_2</b> </br>
		       </li>			
	       	</ul>

		<h4 id="privkey">2.1.2) Private key (X)</h4>
		<p>The private key X consists of t blocks, each containing n pseudorandom bytes.</p>

		<h4 id="pubkey">2.1.3) Public key (Y)</h4>
		<p>The public key Y also consists of t blocks. These blocks are generated by hashing each block of X w-1 times.</p>

		<img src="images/keys.png" alt="keys" width="70%">

		<p> </br> </p>
		<h3 id="siggen">2.2) Signature generation</h3>
		<h4 id="genB">2.2.1) Generation of vector B</h4>
		<p><b>B</b> consists of t blocks. To get these blocks, a checksum of m (m is the hash value of the message) is calculated. To be able to do this, m is converted to base w.</p>
		<p><b>C</b> = checksum = sum of w-1-M_i with 1 <= i <= l_1. </p>
		<p>Now, both m and C are converted to base w, which results in t values (m base w has t_1 values, C base w has t_2 values). 
		If necessary, t_1 and t_2 are padded with 0s in order to calculate their correct values.</p>
		<p>For further calculation, the t values of B are interpreted as integers.</p>
		<p><b>Example:</b> block b_i = 0111 = 7</p>

		<p> </br> </p>
		<h4 id="signature">2.2.2) Signature</h4>
		<p>To generate a signature, each block X_i of the t secret key blocks is hashed b_i times. The results are t blocks, which form the signature sig.</p>

		<img src="images/signature.png" alt="signature" width="70%">

		<p> </br> </p>
		<h3 id="sigver">2.3) Signature validation</h3>
		<p>To validate a signature, the vector B is calculated the same way as in section <a href="#genB">2.2.1</a>.
		Each block sig_i of the signature is hashed w - 1 - b_i times. The resulting check signature consists of the blocks 
		of the private key, which have been hashed w-1 times each (b_i + w - 1 - b_i). Because the public key also consists of the w-1 times hashed blocks of the private key, the public key and the calculated check signature should be the same. If this is the case, the signature is valid.</p>

		<img src="images/validated.png" alt="validated" width="70%">

		<p> </br> </p>
		<h2 id="wotsplus">3) WOTS+</h2>
		<p>The difference between WOTS and WOTS+ is how each block is processed. In WOTS+, an additional bitstring R consisting of w-1 blocks (n bits each) is generated. When hashing the blocks for the xth time, an additional XOR with the xth block of R is applied.</p>

		<h3 id="bitstring">3.1) Bitstring R</h3>
		<p><b>R</b> consists of w-1 blocks, each block containing of n pseudorandom bits, which are added to the beginning of the public key Y.</p>

		<h3 id="example">3.2) Example</h3>
		<p><b>Calculation of the first block of the public key (Y_1):</b> Before hashing the block X_1 for the first time, an XOR operation with the first block of R (R_1) is applied. Before hashing it the second time, an XOR operation with the second block of R (R_2) is applied. Because the block is hashed w-1 times in total, R also consists of w-1 blocks.</br></br>
		<b>Calculation of the first block of the validation signature:</b> Assuming that b_1 = 6 and w = 10, sig_1 will be processed w - 1 - b_1 = 3 times. For the first block, R_1 is not used for the XOR operation, but R_(b_i + 1) is. The reason behind this is to get the correct value, which can be compared to Y_1 (first block of the public key).</p>

		<p> </br> </p>
		<h2 id="security">4) Security</h2>
		<p>For both algorithms it is absolutely necessary that a pair of keys is only used to sign one single message (one-time signature), otherwise it would be possible for an attacker to learn the whole private key by signing two chosen messages. As a solution to this problem, it is possible to authenticate many one-time public keys with a binary tree through a single hash (see Merkle trees).</br></br>

		The security of both algorithms strongly depends on the used hash function. WOTS requires a collision-resistant hash function, WOTS+ a 2nd-preimage-resistent hash function. In conclusion, WOTS+ has less requirements to the used hash function, but is more complex in calculation.</p>
