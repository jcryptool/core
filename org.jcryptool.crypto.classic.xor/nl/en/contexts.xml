    <description>The XOR cipher executes exclusive conjunction (logic XOR) bitwise with the plaintext and the keyword. Another encryption with the same key results in the plaintext again, due to the symmetric nature of the XOR conjunction.
&lt;br&gt;XOR is one of the simplest bit ciphers, and is widely used in modern cryptographic block ciphers.
