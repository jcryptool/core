<h1>Chinese Remainder Theorem</h1>

<p>This plug-in shows the functioning of the <b>Chinese Remainder Theorem</b> (CRT).</p>
<p>The CRT algorithm itself is explained <a href="crtAlgorithm.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>CRT</b> plug-in can be started on the menu <b>Visualization</b>. Its view can be maximized, and with the <b>Restart</b> icon <img src="restart.png"/> (in the upper right) its content can be set to the initial state.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<p align=center><img src="crt_plugin.PNG" width="90%"></p>
</div>

<p>The plug-in consists of two columns: On the left side the computational procedure of the steps is explained, and on the right side the input and results of the current calculation are shown. In the <b>Equations</b> group on the right side of the plug-in the parameters of the equations can be entered.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="crt_equation.PNG" width="85%" />
</div>

<p>Whole, positive numbers (integers) of any size can be used. By pressing the + button, the number of the equations can be increased, and the number can be reduced by the pressing the - button. The minimum number of equations is two. After determining the number of equations and entering the parameters, you can move to the next step by pressing the <b>Next</b> button.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="crt_step1.PNG" width="85%" />
</div>

<p>If the input parameters of the equations were not correct, a dialog box opens.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="crt_equationCheck.PNG" width="85%" />
</div>

<p>In this dialog box, the user has the possibility to correct his input themselve or to allow the program by clicking the button <b>Suggestion</b> to propose a valid value. In both cases the user has to confirm with the <b>Apply</b> button. With the <b>OK</b> button the user returns to the program and the dialog box closes. The group <b>Step 2</b> is activated and the according description of the computational procedure is emphasized.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="crt_step2.PNG" width="85%" />
</div>

<p>The user can now move on to the third step by pressing the button <b>Next</b>. In the group <b>Inverse</b> the intermediate results of the calculations are shown. The accompanying explanation has previously been given in the <b>Step 2</b> group.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="crt_inverse1.PNG" width="85%" />
</div>

<p>Group <b>Step 3</b> describes the calculation of the inverse element.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="crt_step3.PNG" width="85%" />
</div>

<p>The next step (<b>Step 4</b>) is also presented in the <b>Inverse</b> group.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="crt_inverse2.PNG" width="85%" />
</div>

<p>The calculation of the final result is described in the last step, <b>Step 4</b>.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="crt_step4.PNG" width="85%" />
</div>

<p>By pressing the button <b>Result</b>, the final result can now be displayed in the group <b>Verify</b>.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="crt_result.PNG" width="85%" />
</div>

<p>For the user to verify the accuracy of the solution all the equations are shown again in the <b>Verify</b> group.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="crt_verify.PNG" width="85%" />
</div>

<p>The user can display further solutions of the simultaneous congruences by clicking the two buttons <b>Next</b> and <b>Previous</b>. The solutions are shown in the <b>Result</b> group as well as in the <b>Verify</b> group. To initiate a new calculation, it is sufficient to click in the <b>Equations</b> group on the + or - button. This performs a reset of all the input fields besides the ones in the <b>Equations</b> group, and you can add or remove other equations. This reset is possible from any step.</p>

<p>After passing through the algorithm, it is possible to export the calculations. The plug-in supports the output as LaTeX or CSV file. The buttons for exporting can be found in the top right corner of the plugin.</p>
