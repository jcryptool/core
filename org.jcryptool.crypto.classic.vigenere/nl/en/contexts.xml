    <description>The Vigen&#232;re cipher is one of the most widely known substitution techniques. It is a polyalphabetic substitution, and shifts letters of the plaintext down the alphabet, according to the Caesar cipher. The difference is that the key can contain multiple letters, and so the letters are shifted not only by one offset.
&lt;br&gt;The Vigen&#232;re cipher was considered unbreakable a long time, until Charles Babbage succeeded in deciphering it first in 1854.
