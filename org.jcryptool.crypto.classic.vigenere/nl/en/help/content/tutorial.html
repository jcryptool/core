<h1>Vigenère Usage</h1>

<p>This page explains the user interface for the Vigenère cipher. For further information about the Vigenère algorithm itself, see the sub page: <a href="toc_cryptology/toc_cryptology.html">Vigenère Cipher</a>.</p>

<p>Below, the different "groupings" for the options and parameters in the wizard are explained. In the Vigenère wizard, the groupings "Key" and "Operation" are the most important ones.</p>


<h3>Operation &ndash; encryption or decryption</h3>
<p>First, choose, whether you want to en- or decrypt the text in this dialog. As this is a symmetric cipher, a text encrypted with a certain key can be decrypted to the original text, using the same key.</p>


<h3>Alphabet</h3>
<p>The alphabet, over which the cryptographic operations are executed, holds all the characters that these operations will accept and process. Use the "Show alphabet" button to see, which characters the selected alphabet contains.</p>

<p>For example, if you choose an alphabet that holds only UPPERCASE characters (like "Upper Latin (A-Z)"), lowercase characters will not be encrypted. With the checkbox "Filter non-alphabet characters", you can choose whether just to neglect (unchecked), or to completely delete those characters, which would be all lowercase characters in the example.


<h3>Pre-operation text transformation</h3>
<p>If you would like to change the input text before you apply the algorithm, you can check this box, and you will be able to select from a range of text-altering operations after completing this wizard page. For example, you can choose to delete all blanks for increased security.</p>
<p>Pre-operation text transformation should only be used when encrypting a text. When used with decryption, there will be information loss or unreadable text in most cases.</p>


<h3>Key</h3>
<p>The key of the Vigenère cipher is a word, where all characters must be contained in the alphabet selected above.</p>

<p>After finishing the wizard, you should be able to see your en- or decrypted text in the newly opened editor.</p>
