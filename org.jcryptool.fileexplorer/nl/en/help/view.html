	<h1>File Explorer</h1>

	<p>The <strong>File Explorer</strong> view offers easy file system access.<br>
	You can open a file by double clicking on the name which then opens the hex editor. The selected file will be opened in the
	<strong>Hexeditor</strong>. You can use the context menu entry <strong>Open with</strong> to open the
	selected file in an arbitrary JCrypTool editor.</p>

    </div>


	<p>There are additional functions available in the context menu:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Rename</li>
	  <li>Copy</li>
	  <li>Paste</li>
	  <li>Delete</li>
	  <li>Algorithms</li>
	</ul>

  <div class="screenshot">
  	<img src="images/menu_file_explorer.png" alt="Context menu"/>
  </div>

  	<p><strong>Attention: It is not possible to undo file operations like rename or delete. Deleted files are not moved into the
  	trash. Instead they will be deleted directly, and this operation cannot be undone.</strong></p>

	<h2>Algorithms</h2>

	<p>The <strong>Algorithms</strong> menu contains the same algorithms as in the top menu.</p>

	<p>The File Explorers' context menu can be extended by other plug-ins with new entries.</p>
