<h1>Understanding kleptographic attacks</h1>

<p>This guide provides a more in-depth explanation of the key generation attacks
offered by the <i>org.jcryptool.visual.kleptography</i> plug-in. Although kleptographic attacks
can be designed for any asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, this plug-in is based on RSA.
It is assumed that the user is familiar with the mathematics behind RSA encryption.
The ideas and algorithms used in the plug-in are largely based on those from the thorough
and unique book [<a href="#YY04">YY04</a>]. That book is highly recommended for an even more in-depth
analysis of kleptography, as well as cryptovirology in general. A FAQ for cryptovirology
is offered by the authors of the book at [<a href="#Yo06">Yo06</a>].</p>

<p>Kleptography is "the study of stealing information securely and subliminally", as defined by
the authors of [<a href="#Yo06">Yo06</a>], who in fact coined the word.
The idea is to introduce an asymmetric backdoor into a black-box cryptosystem such that
an implementation of this system will appear to function normally for all users except
the individual attacker that can use some special information to aid in decrypting some
or all of the generated key pairs. Even if the black box device were to be opened and investigated,
it would only be possible to notice that an attack is underway, but it would still be
impossible to make use of the backdoor without the attacker's special information.</p>

<p>The authors of [<a href="#YY04">YY04</a>] describe an attack on RSA that meets these criteria.
They call it a secretly embedded trapdoor with universal protection (SETUP) attack.
This plug-in includes</p>

<ul>
<li>a slightly simplified version of the SETUP attack,
<li>three other, less secure attacks, and
<li>honest key generation (for comparison).
</ul>

<p>Each of these attacks assume either that the manufacturer is dishonest and has introduced
some sort of weakness or backdoor into the given cryptographic device, or that an outside attacker has
somehow infected the device and altered it to suit his or her needs.</p>

<p>For more information about these key generation methods and their implementations in this plug-in,
please refer to the pages for each specific algorithm:</p>

<li><a href="prg.html">Generating P via a pseudo-random generator</a>
<li><a href="setup.html">SETUP attack</a>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of demonstrating these attacks in a contained environment is to indicate that it is
essentially impossible to know that your keys are entirely secure. Even the strictest statistical
tests may not reveal the presence of a well-hidden backdoor. You must be able to completely
trust the manufacturer of the cryptosystem implementation and also trust that it has not been
attacked and altered to contain a vulnerability.</p>
