<h1>Explanation of the Dragon Cipher</h1>

<p><b>What is the Dragon Cipher?</b><br>
Dragon was developed by Queensland University of Technology's Information Security<br>
Institute, in Brisbane Australia, for the eSTREAM project. It is a word-based stream cipher,
based on a nonlinear feedback shift register and a nonlinear filter function with memory. It
takes a key and IV, each of 128 or 256 bits, and produces 64 bits of keystream per'round'
- rounds can be performed repeatedly to generate an infinite stream of pseudorandom
data.<br><br>
<b>How does the Dragon Cipher work?</b><br>
Operation of Dragon is in two distinct phases. The initialization stage takes the keying
material (128-bit or 256-bit key and IV) and translates it into a complete internal state for
the cipher instance (1024 bits, plus 64 bits of memory/counter). The keystream generation
stage produces 64 bits of pseudorandom keystream per round of operation.<br>
Both stages utilize the 'update function' F, which uses three 'G' functions (G1, G2 and G3)
and three 'H' functions (H1, H2 and H3). Each of the G and H functions index into two
carefully-selected 8x32-bit S-boxes. The sequential operation of F is depicted as follows:<br>

The initialization stage is performed at the initial keying of the cipher, and on every
rekeying of the cipher. It is recommended that the key be replaced, and the cipher be
rekeyed and reinitialized after every 2^64 bits of generated keystream, for security
reasons. Initialization consists of particular concatenation of the key and IV to produce the
initial 1024-bit state (As well as the 64-bit memory/counter value), followed by sixteen
iterations of the F function. The full initialization procedure is as follows:<br>

Once the cipher has been initialized, keystream generation translates the non-linear
feedback shift register (NLFSR), as well as the memory/counter value, into 64 bits of
keystream and some 'feedback' information that mutates the NLFSR state. The 1024-bit
NLFSR is split into thirty two 32-bit words, labelled B0 through B31. This keystream
generation process is as follows:<br>

<b>Why is the Dragon Cipher useful?</b><br>
The Dragon Cipher has not yet been proven to be insecure (Some attacks, such as a
Distinguishing Attack, have been raised and subsequently dismissed), and so can
arguably be considered to be secure enough to protect sensitive data. It is fast in both
hardware and software, with a 3.2GHz Pentium 4 processor capable of calculating
3.8Gbps of keystream per second, and a hardware implementation using a Samsung ASIC
capable of calculating 23Gbps of keystream per second.<br>
