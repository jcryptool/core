<h1>Tutorial for the Dragon cipher</h1>


<p>This tutorial will guide you through the process of an encryption and a decryption with a modern stream cipher, the Dragon cipher.<br>
Note: As with all algorithms here, you can only perform the following steps when you have an active editor window.</p>

<p>More details about the algorithm itself can be found at <strong><a href="./../tutorial.html">Explanation of the Dragon Cipher</a></strong>.</p>



<h2>Selecting Dragon from the menu or from the Crypto Explorer</h2>

<!-- <img src="overview.png" width="85%"/>
      removed as it was a very old JCT screenshot and as the path for opening the wizard is now described -->

<p>Selecting the menu item <b>Dragon</b> in the menu path <strong><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/algorithms/toc.html">Algorithms</a> → Symmetric</strong> will bring up the wizard for the Dragon cipher. This will be applied to the active editor content  (in example below the texteditor's content is: "This is a JCrypTool text file").</p>



<h2>Setting the parameters in the Dragon dialog for encryption</h2>

<p>Select the size of key and IV: 128 bit or 256 bit. Then enter the according values for key and IV in the selected format (hex or binary). In our example, we use 128 bit as our key/IV size and hexadecimal as the input format for both inputs. Our key has all 128 bit set to "1", and our IV has the value of 1 (i.e. 127 leading "0" bit and one "1" bit). Clicking on the <b>Finish</b> button will start the encryption process.<br>
Note: Modern ciphers work on bits / bytes, but not on characters. So their output is always displayed in a hex editor rather than a text editor.</p>

<h2>Performing the decryption</h2>

<p>The resulting ciphertext (in output001.bin) can be decrypted, by selecting exactly the same parameters as for encryption (as it is a symmetric stream cipher): identical size of key / IV and according values in the same wizard that was used for encryption.</p>

<!-- <img src="figure3.png" width="85%"/>
      removed as it was the same screenshot as figure1 -->

<p>Clicking on the <b>Finish</b> button will now start the decryption of the ciphertext and the correct plaintext is displayed in a new hex editor (out002.bin in the screenshot below).</p>

<h2>Outputting the keystream</h2>

<p>If you use &ndash; in the grouping "Output options"&ndash; the second radio button <b>Display output file and keystream in separate editors</b>  then 2 new hex editor tabs are created: One contains the generated keystream from that encryption / decryption process, the other one contains either the encrypted plaintext or the decrypted ciphertext. A comparison of the keystream from the encryption process to that of the decryption process shows that &ndash; given identical input parameters &ndash; an identical keystream is produced.</p>

<img src="figure5.png" width="85%"/>

<p>The keystream is displayed in a new editor (out004.bin above), with the plaintext being
displayed as usual (out003.bin).</p>

<p>Selecting the radio button <b>Display keystream only</b>, the specified number of bytes of the generated keystream is shown in another hex editor tab. The input area for the number of keystream bytes  to be generated is only enabled if the radio button <b>Display keystream only</b>  is selected.</p>

<img src="figure6.png" width="85%"/>

<p>Our example shows the first 100 bytes of the keystream using the same key and IV as before.</p>
