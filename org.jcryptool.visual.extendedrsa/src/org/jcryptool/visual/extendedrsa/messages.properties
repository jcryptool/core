ExtendedRSA_Visual_4=Extended RSA Cryptosystem (including identities and multi-prime RSA)
ExtendedRSA_Visual_5=This visualization demonstrates the usage of RSA for message encryption. You can incorporate different identities, like \u201EAlice Whitehat\u201C, and encrypt messages for other identities like \u201EBob Whitehat\u201C which only he is able to decrypt again. \u201EBob Whitehat\u201C can do the same with messages for \u201EAlice Whitehat\u201C. You can also add other identities to see how RSA message encryption works with multiple participants.

Identity_0=The identities of your key store are shown as tabs in this plugin. By default, the identities \u201EAlice Whitehat\u201C and \u201EBob Whitehat\u201C are already set up in your key store. So these are the initial tabs in this view.\n\nEach tab represents an identity. With the button \u201EShow/Hide Identity\u201C you can either display or hide existing identities. Newly created identities can be activated with this button and will be shown in the visual.\n\nNote: This area will display further details on the actions selected.
Identity_1=Action: Encrypt and send message\n\nFor encrypting a message, the parameters N and e are required. To get more information on the parameters, see the tab \u201EMy keys\u201C in \u201EManage keys\u201C.\n\nHow to encrypt and send a message:\n\n1) Enter an optional subject and a mandatory message.\n\n2) Select a recipient (\u201EBob Whitehat\u201C e.g.). Note: In this visual only one recipient is allowed.\n\n3) Select the recipient\u2019s public key to be used for encryption.\n\n4) Press the button \u201EEncrypt message\u201C.\n\n5) Press the button \u201ESend message\u201C to send the encrypted message and save it to the message store.

The RSA algorithm is implemented in two variants:\n\n1) For the classic RSA algorithm, two different prime numbers p and q are needed. These numbers can either be chosen, or can directly be entered. If p and q are valid, an exponent e can be chosen, entered or generated.\n\n2) For multi-prime RSA, first the number of primes (between 3 and 5) has to be entered. The parameters can then be specified like in the classic RSA algorithm.\n\nAt the end of the key generation a password for accessing the private key has to be set.\n\nPress the button \u201ECreate key\u201C to create a new key with the selected parameters and store it in the key store.

Identity_8=Action: Manage keys \u2013 My keys\n\nA key pair consists of a \u201Eprivate\u201C and a \u201Epublic\u201C key.\n\na) The private key (N, d):\n - The modulus N is part of both the public and the private key.\n - The private exponent d is the secret part of the scheme and hence only contained in the private key. It is the result of the calculation e^(-1) modulo phi(N).\n\nb) The public key (N, e):\n - The modulus N is part both of the public of the private key\n - The public exponent e (usually between 17 and 65537) must be relatively prime to phi(N).\n\nFor the multi-prime RSA algorithm, more than two prime numbers can be chosen. In this plugin up to 5 primes can be used. In theory though, the number is not limited.

Identity_9=Action: Attack public key\n\nIn this tab you can try to attack a public key. If the modulus N is sufficiently short (less than 256 bit of length), it is feasible to factor N in reasonable time. The factorization results the prime numbers which had been used to calculate the parameters of the private key, and with these prime numbers the private key can be re-calculated. So you can impersonate the original key owner and read messages which are meant to be confidential for the original key owner.\n\nAttention: The factorization can take a long time (depending on the size of N and your hardware). With actual hardware you can factorize the parameter N with a bit length of approximately 64 bit in one hour (tested on a notebook with Intel Core i5 2.4Ghz and 8GB RAM).\n\nAs the security of RSA keys is assumed to be based on the length of the keys, a key length of more than 1024 bit is recommended for encryption.
