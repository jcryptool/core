<h1>Discussion of good and optimal strategies for the Number Shark game</h1>

<p>This chapter dives into a more mathematical and strategic discussion of the Number Shark game.</p>

<h2>1. Definitions</h2>

<p><b>Number set:</b>
<br>The Number Shark game is played with a given amount of numbers. This amount of numbers is called number set.
For further discussion, if not mentioned explicitly, it is assumed,
that the number set is identical to {1,...,N} with N is element of |N.
</p>

<p><b>Path or Move Sequence:</b>
<br>A path or move sequence is a sequence of numbers from the number set, which solves the game for a given N
according to the rules. The move sequence contains only the numbers of the player.
<br><br>e.g. (19,15,14,20,16,12,18)(20) or (19,10,15,20,12,14,18,16)(20) are possible move sequences for N=20.
<br><br>In general a move sequence for N is defined as (a(m))(N) = (n1, n2,...,nm)(N), with m, N is element of |N, N>=2, 
m<=N-1, i,j is element of {1,...,m}, ni is element of the number set, ni != nj for i != j.
</p>

<p><b>Score or Optimal Score:</b>
<br>The sum of all members of a move sequence for N determines the score((a(m))(N)).
<br><br>e.g.
<br>The score((19,15,14,20,16,12,18)(20)) is identical to 19+15+14+20+16+12+18=114.
<br>The score((19,10,15,20,12,14,18,16)(20)) is identical to 19+10+15+20+12+14+18+16=124.
<br><br>In general the score for a move sequence (a(m))(N)= (n1, n2,...,nm)(N) is defined
as score((a(m))(N)) = Sum(i=1 to m)ni.
<br><br>For each N exists per definition an optimal score defined by
<br>optimal score = optimal score({1,...,N}) = optimal score(N) = Maximum((score((a(m))(N))), for all (a(m))(N))
<br>e.g. optimal score(20) = 124.
</p>

<p><b>"Optimal Path" or "Optimal Move Sequence:</b>
<br>If optimal score(N) = score((a(m))(N)) for a move sequence ((a(m))(N)), so it is called optimal path or optimal move sequence.
</p>


<h2>2. Theorems and Observations</h2>

<h3>Theorem 1</h3>
<p><b>The optimal move sequence is not always unambiguous.</b></p>

<p><b>Proof by example:</b>
<br>See the different move sequences for N=20 or N=158 in the <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Appendix.html">Appendix</a>. q.e.d.
</p>

<p> Dan Hoey <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[2]</a> mentioned:
<cite>The game can be played on an arbitrary vertex-labeled directed graph,
and graph-theoretical constraints are useful in reducing the search
space.  For instance, after several moves are made, the divisibility
graph on the remaining choices often becomes disconnected, and the
components can be optimised independently of one another.</cite>
<br>In other words the sequencing of the components can be arbitrary, which leads to multiple optimal move sequences.</p>

<p>Dan Hoey <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[2]</a> already outlined, that the best choice for the first
move is always the highest prime not exceeding N. He gave also a not strict proof. Let me do it in some strict mathematical way.
</p>

<h3>Theorem 2</h3>
<p>Assume {1,...N}, with N is element of |N, is a given number set. hp is the highest prime of the number set,
means hp = Maximum(i), i is element of {1,...N} and hp is prime.
<b>Then the first move to get an optimal score(N) must be always the highest prime hp.</b></p>

<p><b>Example:</b>
<br> Let {1,2,3,4} the number set. hp=3 is the highest prime. For this example it can be easily seen,
if you don't take the 3 as first move, that the 3 is lost to the Number Shark. Thus if you start with the 3
as first move, you can secure this number for your score. </p>

<p><b>Proof by contradiction:</b>
<br>Assume (a(m))(N)) = (n1,n2,...,nm)(N) is an optimal move sequence and
n1 as the number for the first move is not a prime.
<br>That means, optimal score(N) = score((n1,n2,...,nm)(N)).
<br>As composite number, n1 has at least two real divisors. One of these divisors is 1.
<br>Thus the score of ((n1,n2,...,nm)(N)) can be increased by the move sequence
<br>((p,n1,n2,...,nm)(N)), with
score((p,n1,n2,...,nm)(N)) = p + score((n1,n2,...,nm)(N))) and p is prime and element of the number set.
<br>Finally the score((hp,n1,n2,...,nm)(N)) > score((p,n1,n2,...,nm)(N)) with hp as the highest prime in the number set.
<br>But this is in contradiction to our assumption. q.e.d.
</p>

<p>Dan Hoey <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[2]</a> calculated optimal scores up to N=158. He mentioned, that
the optimal move sequence in case of N is a prime is simply identical to the optimal move sequence of N-1, whereby the
leading prime in the move sequence for N-1 is replaced by N. This hint leads us to Theroem 3.
</p>

<h3>Theorem 3</h3>
<p>Assume {1,...N}, with N is element of |N, is a given number set. (a(m))(N)) = (n1,n2,...,nm)(N) is an optimal move sequence.
<b>If N+1 is a prime, then an optimal move sequence for the number set {1,...N+1} is given by (N+1,n2,...,nm)(N+1).
</b></p>

<p><b>Example:</b>
<br> Let {1,2,3,4} the number set. The optimal move sequence is (3,4)(4). 5=4+1 is a prime.
In this case the optimal move sequence is (5,4)(5).</p>

<p><b>Proof:</b>
<br>(a(m))(N)) = (n1,n2,...,nm)(N) is an optimal move sequence.
<br>The optimal score is: score(N) = Sum(i=1 to m)ni = n1 + Sum(i=2 to m)ni.
<br>Theorem 2 says, n1 is the highest prime in the number set {1,...,N}.
<br>So n1 takes away the real divisor 1 from the number set and thus the remaining move sequence (n2,...,nm)
could be interpreted as an optimal move sequence for the number set {2,...,N}\{n1}.
<br>Theorem 2 says, that the first move for the number set {1,...,N,N+1} is the highest prime, thus N+1.
<br>The remaining numbers form the number set {2,...,N}.
<br>On page 34 in <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[5]</a> it is proofed, that for all n > 1, n is element of |N,
at least one prime p exists, with n < p < 2n.
<br>Thus it exists a prime p between floor(N/2) and N.
<br>Furthermore is floor(N/2)+1 <= p, which means 2*floor(N/2)+2 <= 2p.
<br>In addition can it be seen easily, that N < 2*floor(N/2)+2, which means N/2-1 < floor(N/2).
<br>This means with n1 >= p, n1 can not contribute to the optimal score of {2,...,N}, because n1 is not a divisor
for a number in the a number set and n1 has only 1 as divisor, which is not in the number set.
<br>So the optimal score({2,...,N}) = optimal score({2,...,N}\{n1}).
<br>Thus the optimal score(N+1) = N+1 + optimal score({2,...,N}\{n1}) = score((N+1,n2,...,nm)(N+1)). q.e.d.
</p>

<h3>Theorem 4</h3>
<p>Assume {1,...N}, with N is element of |N, is a given number set. (a(m))(N)) = (n1,n2,...,nm)(N) is an optimal move sequence.
<b>Then the optimal score((n1,n2,...,nm)(N)) <= N(N+1)/2 - sum(i=1 to N, i is prime, i!=hp)i - 1, with hp as highest prime.
</b></p>

<p><b>Example:</b>
<br> Let {1,...,20} the number set. If you take the largest prime 19, thus 1 as free divisor of 19 will
be taken by the Number Shark. The primes 2,3,5,7,11,13,17 are still in the number set. If you select
one of them, this number will contribute to the score of the Number Shark. But they (only 2,3,5 and 7) could be still a free divisor
of an other composite number. But even in this case, they will contribute to the Number Sharks score.</p>

<p><b>Proof:</b>
<br>For the given number set {1,...,N} the sum of all numbers according to C.F.Gauss is N(N+1)/2.
<br>After the last move, all numbers are either distributed to the player or to the Number Shark,
<br>thus optimal score(N) + Number Shark score = N(N+1)/2.
<br>According to Theorem 2 to get the optimal score, the first move must be the highest prime hp.
<br>So hp contributes to the optimal score, 1 as real divisor to the Number Shark score.
<br>All other prime numbers have now no real divisors any more, that means, they contribute all to the Number Shark score.
If you select one of them, the prime number will be added to the Number Shark score. Is the prime number a real divisor
of an other number, this number will also contribute to the Number Sharks score. Thus all prime numbers will contribute
to the Number Sharks score.
<br>Thus the optimal is score((n1,n2,...,nm)(N)) <= N(N+1)/2 - sum(i=1 to N, i is prime, i!= hp)i - 1. q.e.d.
</p>

<p>Dan Hoey <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[2]</a> mentioned, that the second move is usually the highest
square of a prime not exceeding N. He argued, that this uses up only one more factor. If you analyse his optimal move sequences,
it seems usually correct. But unfortunately this is not correct in all cases.
</p>

<h3>Theorem 5</h3>
<p>Assume {1,...N}, with N is element of |N, is a given number set. (a(m))(N)) = (n1,n2,...,nm)(N) is an optimal move sequence.
<b>Then the second move n2 is not always the highest square of a prime not exceeding N.
</b></p>

<p><b>Proof:</b>
<br>The figure below shows a divisibility graph (<a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[5], page 25</a>) of N=8.
<br>With Theorem 2 the first move must be the highest prime, thus 7. After this move, the graph
can be modified. The 1 as divisor from 7 and the prime numbers 5 and 7 can be removed from the graph.
If the second move is the highest square of a prime not exceeding 8, it must be 4.
If you select 4, divisor 2 of 4 can be removed from the graph and it remains
the 8, 6 and 4. Only the 6 has still a free, real divisor left. Therefore the 8 can also be deleted from the graph.
Thus the last move is the 6 and the move sequence is (7,4,6), which leads to the score 17.
<br>But for N=8, the optimal score is 21 and an optimal move sequence is (7,8,6). q.e.d.
</p>

<p>Other examples are the cases N=20 and N=120. The corresponding optimal move sequences are listed below. In the case of N=20,
even the highest square of a prime not exceeding 20, which is 9, is not part of the optimal move sequence. For N=120, 25 is the
second move instead of 49. For this move sequences I have no proof. They are based on results of
Dan Hoey <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[2]</a>.
<br>N=20: 19,15,10,20,16,14,12,18,
<br>N=120: 113,25,115,95,85,119,91,77,69,111,93,87,75,74,118,106,94,86,82,50,45,117,99,81,63,105,70,98,42,78,66,110,52,116,104,
100,92,88,76,114,68,102,56,112,84,80,64,60,120,96,90,72,108,
</p>

<p>During my investigations, I observed some behaviour of the move sequences, which motivated me for some ideas.
So far I could not proof these observations, but at least I would like to mention them.</p>

<h3>Observation 1</h3>
<p>Assume {1,...N}, with N is element of |N, is a given number set. (a(m))(N)) = (n1,n2,...,nm)(N) is an optimal move sequence.
Then the optimal score((n1,n2,...,nm)(N)) >= hp + sum(i=K to N, i is not prime), with hp as highest prime. The selection
of K is done in this way, that hp + sum(i=K to N, i is not prime) >= N(N+1)/4 and
hp + sum(i=K+1 to N, i is not prime)i < N(N+1)/4. Or with other words, an optimal move sequence must at least contain all
numbers i, i is element {K,...,N} and i is not prime and hp.
</p>

<p>The Number Shark contains a function to check the observation. The result will be printed
to the console after executing one of the mentioned strategies below.</p>

<h3>Observation 2</h3>
<p>Assume {1,...N}, with N is element of |N, is a given number set. For N>3 exists always a move sequence
(a(m))(N)) = (n1,n2,...,nm)(N) with score((n1,n2,...,nm)(N)) > N(N+1)/4. In other words, you can always
win against the Number Shark. My support feature generates always such a move sequence. Details can be found
in the next chapter.
</p>

<h3>Observation 3</h3>
<p>Assume {1,...N+1}, with N+1 is element of |N, is a given number set. a(m))(N)) = (n1,n2,...,nm)(N) is an optimal move sequence
for the number set {1,...N}. Then
<br>a(m))(N+1)) = (N+1,n2,...,nm)(N) is a optimal move, if N+1 is prime, else f((n1,n2,...,nm)(N))
<br>with f:(n1,n2,...,nm)(N)->(n1,n2,...,nm')(N+1) as not yet known algorithm or function.
<br>If N+1 is prime, Theorem 3 proofs the first part of the recursive algorithm.
<br>My findings for a function f can be find in the next chapter.
</p>

<h3>Observation 4</h3>
<p>The prime numbers play a dominant role to get the optimal score. Give the Number Shark the prime numbers as
slowly as possible. As slowly as possible means only one or two for each move.
During the game it will happen, that composite numbers will become pseudo primes.
I will call composite numbers, which have no free, real divisors any more, pseudo primes.
<br>E.g. at the begin of a game, 12 has the real, free divisors 6,4,3,2 and 1. After playing a while, 12 may have only the
free, real divisors 6 and 4 left. Due to the fact, that 3,2 and 1 are gone, 6 and 4 has no free, real divisors any more,
thus 6 and 4 will be pseudo primes according to my definition.
<br>For larger sizes of the number set pseudo primes has to be taken into account too. So my previous statement could
be changed to try to give the Number Shark as slowly as possible prime and pseudo prime numbers.</p>

<h3>Observation 5</h3>
<p>For the length l of the optimal move sequence the following equation is valid:
<br> l >= floor(N/2) - (pi(N)-pi(ceil(N/2)) + 1, pi(N) is the amount of primes <= N
<br> e.g. N=3, floor(3/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2, -> l >= 1-(2-1)+1 = 1
<br> e.g. N=10, floor(10/2)=ceil(10/2)=5, -> l >= 5-(4-3)+1 = 5
<br> e.g. N=20, floor(20/2)=ceil(20/2)=10, -> l >= 10-(8-4)+1 = 7
<br> e.g. N=51, floor(51/2)=25, ceil(51/2)=26, -> l >= 25-(15-9)+1 = 20
<br> e.g. N=79, floor(79/2)=39, ceil(79/2)=40, -> l >= 39-(22-12)+1 = 30
<br> e.g. N=100, floor(100/2)=ceil(100/2)=50, -> l >= 50-(25-15)+1 = 41
<br> e.g. N=158, flor(158/2)=ceil(158/2)=79, -> l >= 79-(37-22)+1 = 65
<br> e.g. N=256, l >= 106
<br> e.g. N=512, l >= 214
<br> e.g. N=1024 l >= 438
</p>

<p>The Number Shark contains a function to calculate the estimation of the length. The result will be printed
to the console after executing one of the mentioned strategies below.</p>

<h2>3. Strategies</h2>

<p>If you play a little bit around with the game, you will somehow draw conclusion, that the optimal move sequence
<cite>hinge on using up the obligatory factors as slowly as possible <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[2]</a>.</cite>
A good overview of some strategies can be found in <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[3]</a>. I found similar
strategies independently. I will explain the most interesting strategies out of the paper in the next chapter.</p>

<h3>Trono's strategy #3, #7 and #9 (Winner strategy or Support feature)</h3>

<p>In <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Bibliography.html">[3]</a> John Trono mentioned some strategies to calculate a move
course to win the game and to reach a score as high as possible. I tried to implement his strategy #7. With this strategy
he calculated the largest scores for N=256 and N=512 (<a href="NumberSharkHelp-Appendix.html">Appendix</a>).
His strategy is defined as follows.</p>
<p><cite>Use 3 steps: choose the largest prime; then choose the odd numbers, starting with the largest and working
downward until N/2 is reached; and finally choose the even numbers starting at N/2+1 and working upwards towards
N.</cite></p>

<p>Unfortunately I could not reproduce his results. Therefore I decided to implement his strategy #3. This
strategy is defined as follows:</p>
<p><cite>Take always the largest active integer with only one active divisor (smaller than it).</cite></p>

<p>This strategy performs very well for larger number set sizes. You can calculate very fast move sequences with
high scores.</p>

<p>A modification of this strategy is to look only for the largest active integer with the fewest divisors.
This strategy can be modified in the way, that you look for the largest active integer with the fewest divisors,
larger than a certain border value. Trono's strategy #9 uses exactly this strategy with the border N/2-1.
In fact this was my first strategy too. In my case the border value is N/2+1.
By the way, this strategy is implemented for the support feature. My approach was,
to find an always winning strategy, which means to find for each number set a move sequence, which let you win against the
Number Shark. Obviously this strategy solves the problem. For further discussion I will call this the "Winner" strategy.</p>

<h3>Schu's random strategy 1</h3>

<p>My next step was to find a strategy, which could find an optimal score or at least a score as near as possible to an optimal score.
I found out, that the results of my previous "Winner" strategy depends on a clever selected border value. Let's have a look to
an example:
<br>The size N of the number set is 20. In this case my border value would be calculated to 20/2+1 = 11, exactly 12, because
11 is a prime number, which has no effect. Thus my algorithm would not find the optimal score, because 10 is needed (compare
also Theorem 5 or <a href="NumberSharkHelp-Appendix.html">Appendix</a>). But also Trono's strategies would fail, because
the border value would be 20/2-1=9. Thus Trono's strategies would take the 9 as second move, which does not lead to an optimal
score. For N=20 the border value 10 would lead my strategy to an optimal score. In contrast to that for N=21 or N=19, this border
is not optimal. Here again the border value 9 would be the optimal choice.
<br>So the first idea based on this finding may be to run for a given number set the algorithm with different border values
form 0 to N/2+1 to get a score as high as possible. But if you move further to larger number sets, you will see,
that this is not sufficient. Somehow the border value should change even during playing the game.
<br>My second approach was to change randomly the border value from 0 to N/2+1 during the game after each move. This leads already
to better results. But to get better results for larger sizes of the number set pseudo primes have to be taken into account.
Pseudo primes seem to be used seldom, but sometimes they are used. Pseudo primes are located in the interval N to N/2+1.
So I introduced a second border, which will also change randomly in the interval N to N/2+1. So finally my strategy can be
expressed as follows:
</p>
<p>
Step 1: Calculate randomly a first border value out of the interval N/2+1 down to 0.
<br>Step 2: Take the largest active integer with the fewest divisors in the interval N down to a first border value.
<br>Step 3: Calculate randomly a second border value out of the interval N down to N/2+1.
<br>Step 4: Take the largest pseudo prime in the interval N down to a second border value.
<br>Step 5: As your current move take randomly one number out of the numers calculated in step 2 and 4
<br>Step 6: Repeat from step 1 as long as there are still free numbers. 
</p>

<h3>Schu's random strategy 2</h3>

<p>This strategy is similar to strategy 1. The modification is based on the fact, that
at least the largest integer with the fewest divisors in the interval from N down to N/2+1 should be taken
into account. Only if there are numbers in the interval N/2+1 down to 0 with smaller amount of divisors, they are
also from interest. So the strategy 2 can be described as follows:
</p>
<p>
Step 1: Take the largest active integer with the fewest divisor out of the interval N down to N/2+1.
<br>Step 1: Calculate randomly a first border value out of the interval N/2+1 down to 0.
<br>Step 2: Take all active integers in the interval N down to a first border value,
<br>whose amount of divisors are smaller as the amount of divisors from the number in step 1.
<br>Step 3: Calculate randomly a second border value out of the interval N down to N/2+1.
<br>Step 4: Take the largest pseudo prime in the interval N down to a second border value.
<br>Step 5: As your current move take randomly one number out of the numbers calculated in step 1, 2 and 4
<br>Step 6: Repeat from step 1 as long as there are still free numbers.
</p>

<h3>Schu's recursive strategy</h3>

<p>Based on observation 3 I implemented a recursive algorithm. To define a proper function f, I analysed
all optimal move sequences. I observed, that during the transition from the optimal move sequence from N to N+1 only
a part of the numbers are changing. Very often one of the three different cases below occurred:
</p>
<p>
Case 1: Only the new number N+1 was added and the rest of the move sequence from N is kept.
<br>Case 2: The new number N+1 was added and the rest of the move sequence N is kept beside one.
<br>Case 3: The new number was added and the rest of the move sequence N is kept beside one, which was replaced by a new number.
</p>
<p>
In general it can be observed, that from N -> N+1 either the length of the move sequence is kept or increased by one.
Always the new number N+1 is kept plus the rest of the move sequence N is kept beside r numbers, with r is element of
{0,...,R}, R is element of |N and R >=7. I listed the differences from N->N+1 below. There are only differences with
r > 2 mentioned. All others differences are 1 or 2. At least up to N=158, the transition from 127 to 128 showed the largest difference 7.
That's why I defined R>=7.
</p>
<p>
N= number set size (differences of the optimal move sequence from N->N+1)
<br>N=20(3), N=34(3), N=44(3), N=53(5), N=69(3), N=76(4), N=77(3), N=80(5), N=83(4), N=104(3), N=119(5), N=125(4), N=127(7)
</p>

<p>They current version of the Number Shark program has implemented a function f, which tries to realise the three cases
mentioned above. Other functions will be implemented in future versions.</p>
