<h1>Substitution Cipher</h1>

<p>
	The (monoalphabetic) substitution cipher replaces each letter in the text with another, based on an key alphabet (generated from a keyword).

<h4>Encryption</h4>

<p>The monoalphabetic substitution replaces
(substitutes) letters from the plain text, a, with letters from the cipher text
alphabet, a‘. Every letter a has exactly one mapped a’, and every a’ is mapped
to a letter a from the plain text alphabet at most once. Thus, it is a bijective
mapping, and can be defined, based on the plain text alphabet, by specifying a
substitution alphabet, which can have equal or more elements than the plain
text alphabet. The character at index m of the plain text alphabet will always
be mapped to the character at index m of the substitution alphabet. Such, the
substitution alphabet is the key of the monoalphabetic substitution.</p>

<p>Writing down a whole alphabet is unhandy, so
the substitution alphabet is generated from a key string in most cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>The keyword may only contain characters from the
substitution alphabet</li>

<li>Multiple occurrences of characters are removed –
each character may only occur once.</li>

<li>Fill up the key word with characters from the
plaintext alphabet (append) until the necessary length (the length of the plain
text alphabet) is reached.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now an example: The word “SECRET” has to be
encrypted with the keyword “KEY”. Below are the alphabets – in this notation it
becomes clear how the substitution mapping works – replace each character from
the first row with the one below it in the second row).</p>

<p>The encrypted word is „WIGVIX“.</p>


<h4>Decryption</h4>

<p>At the decryption, the substitution mapping
is inverted. It’s also possible to be defined as encryption with the former plaintext
alphabet, taking the former substitution alphabet as actual plaintext alphabet.
In the scheme above, all characters from the second row would be replaces with
the ones above them (first row).</p>
