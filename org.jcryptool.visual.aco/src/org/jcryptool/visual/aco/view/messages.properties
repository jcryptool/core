Info_description1=This visualization demonstrates, how to anaylse a simple transposition encryption (permutations chiffre) and break the encryption by the ant colony optimization.\n\For the analysis a given ciphertext can be used or a new text can be generated from a plaintext. For this generation the plaintext will be put in a matrix whose number of columns equal to the chosen length of key for the transposition. If the plaintext length is not a dividable by the key length, e.g. the last cells of the matrix will remain empty, random characters will be placed in those cells. Finally the chiper text is extracted column wise which respect to the chosen permutation.\n\nIf a key length between 3 and 5 was chosen, the analysis will be demonstrated in a graph.
Info_description2=Now we move on to the cryptanalysis.\n\nBased on the key length first the columns of the encryption matrix are reconstructed. Herefrom a graph is build where every knot corresponds to a column of the matrix.\nThe key length can be investigated by statistical tests. In contrast to that the determination of the right order of the columns is the difficult part of the cryptanalysis. This is where the Ant Colony Optimization comes into play. At first an ant is placed randomly on one knot of the graph.
Info_description3=Every trail through the graph including every knot exactly one time corresponds to a possible decryption as one may reconstruct the encryption matrix by concatenating the columns in the order the corresponding knots were passed in the trail and then read out the plaintext line by line.\n\nThe probability with which an ant chooses a certain not yet passed knot to be the next one in the trail depends on two measures./n/n First the bigrams that occur by concatenating the last column with the possible next columns are examined and compared to ordinary bigrams that occur in texts of natural languages.\nE.g. if an ant is located at a column starting with a Q a column starting with a U gets a higher probability to be the next in the trail than one starting with a X since the combination QU is much more frequent in natural languages than the combination QX.\n\nIn addition to that certain values are assigned to all edges of the graph. These values are all equal at the beginning and change after an ant has finished its trail through the graph. Based on the analogy to real ants these values are called pheromone values.\nBy using the Sliders Alpha (pheromone) and Beta (bigrams) one can determine the influence the two measures should have on the choice of the ant.\n\n
Info_description4=As soon as an ant has finished its trail through the graph the resulting solution will be evaluated. Therefore the derived plaintext is compared to a wordlist containing common words of a natural language (depending on the selected language) with at least three letters. The length of the words found in the possible decryption are squared, summed up and divided by the length of the text.\nThe resulting value is added to the pheromone values that correspond to the edges that build up the trail which led to the decryption. Apart from that a reduction of all pheromone values takes place. This corresponds to a evaporation process in the natural role model. This parameter can also be modified by a slider on the left side of the tutorial. In order to observe how the pheromone values develop over several iterations of the algorithm one can now send out more ants.

Header_text = This visuals shows a method to decrypt a text, which has previously been encrypted by a permutation cipher, without knowing the key. For the decryption a graph will be generated. The number of vertices of the graph corresponds to the length of the key which was used by the encryption. Then, the letters of the ciphertext will be assigned to the knots in the graph. Randomly a vertex of the graph will be chosen, marked as visited, and transition probabilities \u2012 based on local information \u2012 to unvisited knots will be calculated. Based on the calculated probabilities, an unvisited vertex in the graph will be picked and this iteration will be repeated until all knots are marked as visited. The chosen knots represent a path in the graph. By concatenating the letters along the path, a possible plaintext is formed. In each iteration a candidate for the plaintext is generated, by repeating the steps a lot of times the correct plaintext will most likely be the candidate with the highest probability. As for the calculation of the transition probabilities local information and especially information about previously token paths \u2012 similar to the orientation of ants \u2012 will be taken into account, the algorithm is called the Ant Colony Optimization.
