GFlow_0=Alice chooses a bit a from {0,1}. Then she creates an\nisomorphism g and a new graph H she sends to Bob:\nH = g(G_a)\n
GFlow_1=Bob chooses a bit b from {0,1} and sends b to Alice.\nHe asks Alice for an isomorphism h from G_b to H.
GFlow_10=Compute isomorphism
GFlow_11=Verify
GFlow_2=Depending on a and b, Alice computes the iso-\nmorphism asked by Bob. She sends it to Bob:\nh = g f^(a-b)
GFlow_3=Bob verifies the answer from Alice: H = h(G_b).
GFlow_4=Carol guesses a bit a from {0,1}. Then she creates an\nisomorphism g and a new graph H she sends to Bob:\nH = g(G_a)
GFlow_5=Bob chooses a bit b from {0,1} and sends b to Carol.\nHe asks Carol for an isomorphism h from G_b to H.
GFlow_6=Carol computes h and sends it to Bob:\nh = g
GFlow_7=Bob verifies the answer from Carol:\nH = h(G_b).
