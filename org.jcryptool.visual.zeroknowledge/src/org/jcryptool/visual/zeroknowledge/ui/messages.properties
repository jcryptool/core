Generator_0=Prime numbers have an important part in cryptography. Here you generate two random prime numbers p and q of the\nrange [2^minimum level, 2^maximum level].\nThe sum of the maximum levels must be less then 30.
Generator_1=Range of both prime numbers
Generator_10=p: upper limit must be a number
Generator_11=sum of upper limits > 30
Generator_12=q: lower limit must be set
Generator_13=q: upper limit must be set
Generator_14=q: lower limit must be a number
Generator_15=q: upper limit must be a number
Generator_16=sum of upper limits > 30
Generator_17=Generate the primes p and q
Generator_18=Take prime numbers
Generator_19=Takes the given prime numbers
Generator_2=Enter independently from each other
Generator_20=Cancel
Generator_21=Ends the dialog without taking the prime numbers
Generator_3=Both equal (just enter one)
Generator_6=Generate prime numbers
Generator_7=p: lower limit must be set
Generator_8=p: upper limit must be set
Generator_9=p: lower limit must be a number
Introduction_0=Situation
Introduction_10=Prover
Introduction_22=Choose two prime numbers p and q. The digit n = pq is the public module. Carol affirms she was\n Alice and knew a vector s with v_i = (s_i)\u00B2 mod n. v is published.
Introduction_24=Choose two prime numbers p and q. The digit n = pq is the public module. Carol affirms she was\n Alice and knew a digit s with v = s\u00B2 mod n. v is published.
Introduction_26=Carol wants to make Bob think she is Alice. She knows, that Alice knows an isomorphism f\nfrom G_0 to G_1. She wants to convince Bob, that she knows f, although she does not.
Introduction_28=Carol (C) affirms to be Alice and to know a secret Code for the door\nbetween room 1 and 2. She shall identify herself to Bob (B).
Introduction_29=Attacker
Introduction_3=Choose two prime numbers p and q. The digit n = pq is the public module. Alice knows a vector s with\nentries s_i < n with gcd(s_i, n) = 1, and a vector v with v_i = (s_i)\u00B2 mod n. v is published.
Introduction_5=Choose two prime numbers p and q. The digit n = pq is the public module. Alice knows a digit s < n\nwith gcd(s, n) = 1 and v = s\u00B2 mod n. v is published.
Introduction_7=This protocol is based in the problem of finding isomorphisms between graphs. Alice knows\nan isomorphism f from G_0 to G_1. Bob wants Alice to prove, that she really knows g.
Introduction_9=Alice (A) affirms to know a secret code for the door between room 1 and 2.\nShe shall identify herself to Bob (B).
