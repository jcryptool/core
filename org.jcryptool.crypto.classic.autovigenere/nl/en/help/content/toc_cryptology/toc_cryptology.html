<h1>Autokey-Vigenère cipher</h1>
<p>
	The Autokey-Vigenère cipher works like the Vigenère cipher, but appends the plaintext to the keyword instead of just extending the keyword to plaintext length.
</p>

<h3 id="classification">Classification</h3>
<p>
	The Autokey-Vigenère cipher is, like the pure Vigenère cipher, a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. The difference to the pure Vigenère cipher is, that the effective "key" is constructed from the keyword and the plaintext itself, and not just from the infinite concatenation of the keyword (as in the pure Vigenère cipher).

<h3 id="algorithm">The en- and decryption algorithm</h3>
<p>The Autokey-Vigenère cipher is, as the name
says, a special Vigenère-cipher, where the key (or: the substitution alphabets,
or: the Caesar alphabets) is generated not only from the keyword, but also from
the plain text. Because the special key generation aside, there is no
difference to the normal Vigenère algorithm, just the key generation and two
examples (encryption and decryption) will be explained here. Please refer to
the Article on the Vigenère cipher for the encryption and decryption
functionality.</p>

<h4>Encryption</h4>

<p>At the Vigenère algorithm, the substitution
alphabets for each character of the plain text were created, by using the
components (numbers or letters of the plain text alphabet) of the key word repeatedly
(periodical appending of the key to itself until the length of the plain text
was reached). The Autokey-Vigenère algorithm is using the key word components
one time, and then takes the letters of the plaintext for substitution. Writing
it under the plain text, it results in first the key word, concatenated with
the plain text itself.</p>

<p>As example, the text „ATTACKATMIDNIGHT“ will
be encrypted with the key word “KEY”:</p>

<h4>Decryption</h4>

<p>Receiving an Autokey-Vigenère cipher text,
how to decipher it, knowing just the key word? Initially, the decoder doesn’t know
all substitution alphabets which were used for encryption – just the first few of
them (the key word). Further, he knows, that the following, yet unknown
substitution alphabets are (generated by) the subsequent plain text letters. He
must now decipher the first part of the plain text with the key word, decipher
the next sequence of plain text with these letters, and continue with the newly
deciphered plain text (= key sequence) letters, …</p>

<p>An example (deciphering the ciphertext from
above) will make it a bit clear:</p>

<p><img id="Grafik 1" src="decryption_example.png" alt="decryption_example.png" width="85%" /></p>

<p>(The decryption mechanism, when the substitution alphabet for a position is known, is similar to the Vigenère algorithm, as already said)</p>
