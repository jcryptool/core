		<b>Encryption ID</b>
	</p>
	<p>An XML document can contain multiple encryptions with different
		encryption IDs. You do not have to decrypt them in document order.
		Instead, you can choose which one you want to decrypt (make sure to
		provide the corresponding keystore and key information, otherwise
		decryption will fail). However, this requires an ID for the XML
		encryption. Since IDs are optional you can choose to decrypt the first
		encrypted part in the XML document instead. In case the XML document
		contains multiple encryptions without IDs you'll have to decrypt them
		step by step. In order to avoid that always provide encryption IDs
		when encrypting XML data.</p>
