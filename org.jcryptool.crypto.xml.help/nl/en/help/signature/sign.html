	<p>
		The <b>XML Signature Wizard</b> consists of three pages, with a
		variable second page depending on the chosen keystore/ key option. To
		launch the wizard you either have to select an XML document in one of
		the supported views in the XML perspective or open an XML document in
		the WTP XML editor (in any perspective). Open the context menu, choose
		<b>XML Security</b> and click on <b>New Signature...</b>. In order to
		sign a selected XML fragment select the desired document part in the
		editor and launch the wizard as described before. The selection has to
		exist before launching the wizard, and it has to be well-formed: in
		case a start-tag is selected the end-tag must be selected too. Signing
		only text-content of an element is possible too.
