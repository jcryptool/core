	<p>This is the first page of the XML Signature Wizard. You'll have
		to select the resource you want to sign, the signature type, the
		keystore/ key option and the Basic Security Profile option.</p>

		<b>Resource</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		It is possible to sign the complete document, the selected text or a
		document fragment specified by an XPath expression. The complete
		document is always possible. For a text selection this selection has
		to exist before launching the wizard and it has to be well-formed.
		XPath is always possible too. You can either enter an XPath expression
		in the textfield or you can select one in the dialog after clicking on
		the <b>Browse...</b> button. The XPath expression has to return
		exactly one element or element content. Signing attributes is not
		supported.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Signature Type</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		There are three different signature types available. The difference
		between them is the position of the signed data and the signature
		itself.An <i>enveloped</i> and an <i>enveloping</i> signature are
		relatively equal. Both types to store the signed data (and possibly
		some unsigned data as well) together with the signature in the same
		XML document. With the <b>XML Security Tools</b> the signature will be
		placed in the XML document you have chosen to sign.So, the difference
		between an enveloped and an enveloping signature is, that with an
		enveloping signature the signed content is moved inside the XML
		signature element (into an <i>object</i> element). With an enveloped
		signature, the signature is a child element of the signed data. A
		detached signature may be something completely different. The normal
		detached signature consists of two documents: one containing the
		signature and one containing the signed data. To make it more
		complicated you can create a detached signature within one document
		too (but not with the <b>XML Security Tools</b>). With the XML
		Signature Wizard you do have to select a file to sign when selecting
		to create a detached signature.
	</p>
	<p>Confused about all the possibilities? Well, there are quite
		some, and the differences are not often that clear. Simply give it a
		try and sign your XML documents with the different signature types.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Keystore and Key</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		The chosen option here sets the following wizard page. You can either
		select to <a
			href="page_open_key.html">Use
			a key from an existing keystore</a>, to <a
			href="page_create_key.html">Insert
			a new key in an existing keystore</a> or to <a
			href="page_create_keystore.html">Create
			a new key and a new keystore</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Basic Security Profile</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		A Basic Security Profile compliant XML Signature has some restrictions
		in comparison to a regular XML Signature. By activating this checkbox
		all options in the XML Signature Wizard will be limited to options
		that are compliant to this profile. In case of the XML Signature
		Wizard this only limits the available algorithms on the <a
			href="page_algorithms.html">Algorithms
			and Signature Properties</a> page.
