	<p>
		This is the last page of the XML Signature Wizard. You must select
		algorithms for the message digest and the signature as well as a
		canonicalization and transformation algorithm. Optional, you can
		define some signature properties and you can enter a signature ID
		(strongly recommended). The <b>Start Encryption Wizard afterwards</b>
		checkbox enables you to start the encryption wizard after successfully
		signing the selected XML document.

	<p>
		<b>Canonicalization and Transformation Algorithm</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Choose the algorithms you want to use for canonicalization and
		transformation. Whereas canonicalization is required, the
		transformation algorithm can be set to <i>none</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Message Digest and Signature Algorithm</b>
	</p>
	<p>Choose the algorithms you want to use for the message digest and
		for the signature itself. Both algorithms are required and must be
		compatible with the selected key on the previous wizard page.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Properties</b>
	</p>
	<p>There is only one property available: Keep root element as plain
		text. This creates an encrypted XML document (fragment) with a root
		element in plain text. In case you selected to encrypt the whole
		document the documents root element will be kept as plain text. In
		case you selected to encrypt a document fragment only (via a text
		selection or an XPath expression) this will result in a plain text
		root element of this document fragment.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Signature ID</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		The signature ID is optional, but it is strongly required to enter
		one. This ID must be unique in the whole document and may not contain
		&lt;, &gt;, &amp;, ' or " characters. Without a signature ID it might
		get difficult to verify multiple signatures in one document and it is
		impossible to use <b>Quick Verification</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Encryption Wizard</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Select the checkbox in case you want to start the <a
			href="../encryption/encrypt.html">XML Encryption Wizard</a> directly after the signature process was
		successfully finished.
