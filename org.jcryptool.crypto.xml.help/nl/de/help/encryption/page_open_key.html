		<b>Use a Key from an existing Keystore</b> is one of the alternatives
		as the second wizard page. Simply select the keystore containing the
		key you want to use in the current encryption process. All data is
		verified, you can only switch to the next case with a correct keystore
		and key password as well as an existing key alias.

	<p>The wizard automatically stores the entered data for the
