      <description>
         JCrypTool comes with two perspectives: <b>Default</b> and <b>Algorithm</b>. You can switch between those two perspectives in two different ways: By using the menu entry <b>Window → Open Perspective</b>  or by using the icons in the upper right of the window. Only one perspective can be active at a time (you can recognize the active one by the selected icon).

      <description>
         JCrypTool contains an almost countless number of views. The easiest way to open one is to use the menu <b>Window → Show View</b>. You can use both editors to create new files and you can open arbitrary files with them.
