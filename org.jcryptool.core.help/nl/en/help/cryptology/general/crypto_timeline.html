<h1>Time-table / time-travel through cryptography and cryptanalysis</h1>

<P>This <B>overview</B> of the various <B>cryptographic algorithms</B> is a chronological history of cryptology, whose origins date back to the days of antiquity and which over time has undergone steady refinement of its methods. Please note that this table is by no means complete.</P>

<P>The first human writing dates back more than 6000 years. Encryption has been in existence for around 3000 years.</P>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD>c. 500-1400 AD</TD>
<TD>The "dark age of cryptography" began in Europe: During this period cryptography was considered as black magic art and a lot of knowledge was lost. By contrast cryptography flourished in the Persian world. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD>855 AD</TD>
<TD>In the Arabic world the first book on cryptology appeared. Among other things, Abu 'Abd al-Raham al-Khahil ibn Ahmad ibn'Amr ibn Tammam al Farahidi al-Zadi al Yahamadi (Abu-Yusuf Yaqub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi, called <B>Al-Kindi</B>) proudly described in his book the successful decryption of a Greek ciphertext that was intended for the Byzantine Emperor. His solution was based on frequency analysis and on known (correctly guessed) plaintext at the message start -- a standard cryptanalytic method, used even in WW-II against Enigma messages.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD>1379</TD>
<TD>When the pontifex Clement VII escaped to Avignion, he made his secretary Gabrieli di Lavinde (Parma) to develop a new code, which became the <B>nomenclature code</B>, a combination of substituting single letters of the alphabet and code words: He built a list of the most common words together with 2-letter substitutes. The words, that weren't on the list were encrypted with monoalphabetic substitution.<BR>
Due to its simplicity this nomenclature code was used over the next 450 years especially in diplomatic circles.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD>1412</TD>
<TD>A 14-volume Arabic encyclopaedia also described cryptographic methods. Here, in addition to <B>substitution</B> and <B>transposition</B>, the method of <B>repeated substitution</B> applied to a plaintext character was mentioned the first time.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD>15th century</TD>
<TD>Boom of cryptology in Italy because of highly developed diplomatic life.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD>1466</TD>
<TD>Leon Battista <B>Alberti</B>, one of the leading figures of the Italian Renaissance, published his book "Modus scribendi in ziferas", in which the cipher wheels invented by him were mentioned for the first time. He also published the first polyalphabetic cipher. Alberti was secretary of an official body concerned with cryptographs (ciphers) at the papal court in Rome. He is known as the "father of cryptography".</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD>1518</TD>
<TD>The first printed book on cryptology titled "Polygraphia libri sex", written by the abbot Johannes <B>Trithemius</B>, appeared in the German-speaking world. He also described polyalphabetic ciphers in the now-standard form of rectangular substitution tables.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD>1563</TD>
<TD>Giovanni Battista <B>Porta</B> published "De Furtivis Literarum Notis", a book describing encryption methods and cryptanalysis. In it the first digraph substitution cipher is mentioned.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD>End of 16th century</TD>
<TD>France got the lead in cryptanalysis.</TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD>1585</TD>
<TD>The 600-page book "Tractié de Chiffre" by the French diplomat, Blaise de Vigenère, appeared. He discovered the first working polyalphabetic system with autokey, called "Le chiffre indéchiffrable". Later the weaker <B>Vigenère code</B> was named after him. This code is the most well-known of all the poly-alphabetic algorithms.<BR>
The autokey idea survived today e.g. in the DES CBC and CFB modes.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD>1586</TD>
<TD>The <B>Babington plot</B> tried to kill the Queen Elisabeth I. of England and to replace her on the throne by <B>Mary Stuart</B>, Queen of Scotland.
<BR>
Successful cryptanalysis by the "British secret service" enabled to get the six conspirators and to condemn Mary.
<BR>
Mary communicated via letters with her conspirators. The bearer of the messages was a spy of Elisabeth: He made exact copies of the letters and sent them to Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's secretary of state. Walsingham engaged Thomas <B>Phelippes</B>, a cipher and language expert, to decrypt the messages. Successful decryption revealed the plot against Elisabeth. But Walsingham additionally wanted the identity of the conspirators: He made Phelippes forge a postscript, and Mary added the enciphered names of the conspirators in her answer.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD>17th century</TD>
<TD>The era of the <B>black chambers</B> began. Most governments had their own department with professional code breakers, who systematically broke the used nomenclature codes.</TD>

<TD>1623</TD>
<TD>Sir Francis <B>Bacon</B> described a method of steganography: To encode a message each letter of the plain text is replaced by a group of five of the letters 'A' or 'B' interspersed into normal text with different typeface. This is a forerunner of what today is called a 5-bit binary encoding.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD>1628</TD>
<TD>Antoine <B>Rissignol</B> became the first full-time cryptanalyst being employed after his decryption of an hostile encoded message, which terminated the siege of Realmont by the Huguenots. Since then, cryptanalysts have always been a fixed element in military organizations.</TD>
