	<h2 id="opennew">Quick way to open a new editor</h2>

	<p>To open a new editor (text or hex, empty or filled with a default file) just click on the leftmost icon in the <strong>main toolbar</strong> or the drop-down arrow next to the right. See the screenshots with important icons in the help file <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/general/toc.html">General Information</a>.</p>





<p> </br> </p>
	<h2 id="max">Maximizing the window of a plugin</h2>

	<p>You might have opened the default view of JCrypTool (JCT) with editors, the context help, and some visualizations. If you then want one of them to be maximized just <strong>double-click</strong> on the tab (e.g. on the "Frequency Analysis" tab within the visualizations).</p>

	<h2 id="fastinfo">How to quickly find information in JCrypTool</h2>

	<p>First of all, you can click the magnifying glass icon in the <strong>main toolbar</strong> in order to get help about a particular topic. Then the <b>Quick Access search field</b> (Ctrl-3) opens: Preferably, you can look for the name of plug-ins or of methods (if looking for strings in the online help click the according item which opens the list in another browser tab). The search filter reacts at once, even before the term in typed in completely. Maybe you want to try with "Vig" or "Elie".</p>

	<p>Alternatively, you can open the exhaustive online help in a browser: To do so, click in JCT on the question-mark icon within the <strong>main toolbar</strong>. Within the online help then click on the left on the entry <b><img src="./../images/plus.svg" /><img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/images/toc_open.svg" />User Guide</b>. Now you can see the different categories, used to structure the help in JCT. To open a category, please click on the small plus icon in front of the particular category. So you can navigate to the according help page and get a good overview. Alternatively, you can use the search field (at the top below the browser toolbar) in the online help.</p>

	<h2 id="languageswitch">Changing the language in JCrypTool</h2>
	
	<p>In the general preferences of JCrypTool (JCT) you can change the language. After a change JCT asks you to automatically restart with the new selected language. Further details about this can be found in <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/general/language.html">Changing the Language</a>.</p>
	





	
<p> </br> </p>
	<h2 id="updating">Updating JCrypTool</h2>
	
	<p>JCrypTool contains an integrated update mechanism. Details about this and hints for problem solving can be found in <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/general/updates.html">Updates</a>.</p>
	
	<!--- Just as info: this was it before using PLUGINS_ROOT

<p> </br> </p>
	<h2 id="usb">Using JCrypTool in a network environment or on a USB stick</h2>

	<p>In principle it is possible to use JCrypTool in a network environment or on an external storage medium like a USB stick or a USB hard disk. To enable this you have to do a minor change in one of the configuration files: It is necessary to change the path to the default workspace folder. This folder is used by all plug-ins to store your specific preferences.</p>

	<p><strong>Windows/ Linux:</strong></p>
	<p>Open the file <strong>JCrypTool.ini</strong> in your installation folder and search for the line
	<strong>-data @user.home/documents/.jcryptool</strong>. Replace <strong>@user.home/documents/.jcryptool</strong> with the absolute path to a folder available in your environment.</p>

	<p><strong>macOS:</strong></p>
	<p>The required changes are identical with the ones described above for Windows/Linux. However, the file
	<strong>JCrypTool.ini</strong> is located at <strong>JCrypTool.app\Contents\MacOS</strong> in your installation folder.</p>
