	<h1>About JCrypTool</h1>

	<p>JCrypTool (JCT) is an extendable e-learning platform presenting cryptography, cryptanalysis, and IT Security in a modern and easy-to-use fashion.</p>
	
    <p>JCrypTool is built as platform-independent open-source software and is part of the open-source project <a href="http://www.cryptool.org/">CrypTool</a>.</p>
	
    <p>A tabular overview about all functions in all CrypTool programs including JCT can be found at the CrypTool website in the <a href="https://www.cryptool.org/en/ctp-documentation/functionvolume">function overview</a>.</p>

	<p>An exhaustive overview what you can do with JCT can be found in the <a href="https://www.cryptool.org/en/jct/documentation/user-presentation">User presentation of the JCrypTool project</a>.</p>
	
	<p>JCT is developed since 2009. More than 200 people contributed. After many weekly builds, beta versions and 9 milestone versions, the release 1.0 was published in November 2020. JCT contains about 250 cryptologic functions, many of them as visualizations. We learned a lot about remote and agile programming, and about the hurdles of the Java infrastructure. And most important, we hope the users will have fun learning and experiencing cryptography and cryptanalysis.</p>
