	<p>JCrypTool (JCT) is a free and open-source cryptographic e-learning software with many visualizations.</p>
    <p>It is based on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> Rich Client Platform (RCP). You will recognize a lot of concepts in case you ever worked with Eclipse or an Eclipse RCP.</p>


	<h2 id="first">First steps and help</h2>
	<p>Beginner or not, the <strong>User Guide</strong> will introduce you in the many possibilities you have with JCrypTool. The following pages therefore contain information about the different <a href="general/editors.html">Editors</a>, <a href="general/views.html">Views</a> and <a href="general/perspectives.html">Perspectives</a>. And of course the crypto plug-ins, starting from <a href="algorithms/toc.html">Algorithms</a>, <a href="analysis/toc.html">Cryptanalysis</a>, <a href="games/toc.html">Games</a>, and last but not least <a href="visualizations/toc.html">Visualizations</a>.</p>

    <p>The online help (User Guide) for JCT is available in English and German. The content of the <strong>User Guide</strong> is delivered by the developers of the crypto plug-ins. This means that one plug-in may contain more help, the other one less. The JCT core team tries to ensure a minimum and consistent quality over all plug-ins and their according online help.</p>

	
	<p>The user guide shows different categories, which structure the online help in JCT, e.g. <b><img src="images/plus.svg" /><img src="images/container_topic.svg" /> General Information</b> or <b><img src="images/plus.svg" /><img src="images/container_topic.svg" /> Cryptology</b> or <b><img src="images/plus.svg" /><img src="images/container_topic.svg" /> Visuals</b>. These categories can be opened by clicking on the plus icon in front the according entry. So you can navigate down to the help page you are looking for.	
	</p>

	
	
	<p>Please start reading with the help file <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/general/toc.html">General Information</a>, which contains screenshots with the JCT window components, and explains how to start the online help and where to find icons with important functions.</p>
