	<h1>Perspectives</h1>

	<p>Perspectives can be regarded as containers, in which other components, namely <a href="views.html">views</a> and <a href="editors.html">editors</a>, are embedded and can be layouted in almost any way you desire.</p>

	<p>JCrypTool offers two perspectives: <a href="perspective_default.html">Default</a> and
  	<a href="perspective_algorithm.html">Algorithm</a>. The <strong>Default Perspective</strong> shows all possibilities in a usual way &ndash; with menus and views for the beginner. The <strong>Algorithm Perspective</strong> is more suitable for advanced users and offers many variants of the cryptographic operations.</p>

	<p>Initially, JCrypTool offers a pre-defined layout of both perspectives. In case of mis-configuration or other problems you can use the menu <strong>Window -> Reset Perspective</strong> to go back to the initial configuration of that perspective.</p>

	<p>After launching JCrypTool, always the last active perspective is shown. In order to switch between the existing perspectives, use the buttons <a href="perspective_default.html">Default</a> and <a href="perspective_algorithm.html">Algorithm</a> in the upper right of the main window, or the menu <strong>Window -> Open Perspective</strong>. The menu <strong>Window -> Customize Perspective</strong> opens a dialog in which you can select the elements (menu entries and toolbar icons) that should be displayed in the current perspective.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Views in different perspectives are independent of each other. Closing or moving a view in the Default Perspective has absolutely no effect on the same view in the Algorithm Perspective. On the other side, editors are shared between perspectives. Closing an editor in the Default Perspective closes this editor in the Algorithm Perspective as well.</p>
