    <h1>Cheat Sheets</h1>

    <p>Cheat sheets are small, often interactive, step by step instructions for JCrypTool. Cheat sheets are, as everything else
    in JCrypTool, delivered by (crypto) plug-ins. However there are some basic cheat sheets available that should make your first
    steps easier.</p>

    <p>No matter which cheat sheet you decide to run, you have to launch the cheat sheet dialog via <strong>Help -> Cheat Sheets...</strong>.
    Select the desired cheat sheet and click on OK. A new <a href="views.html">view</a> opens, showing you the selected cheat sheet with all its
    steps.</p>

    <div class="screenshot">
    	<img src="images/cheatsheets.png" width="358" height="465" alt="Cheat Sheets"/>
    </div>

    <p>Use the <strong>?</strong> icon in the cheat sheet to open the normal help for additional information. Work step by step through the cheat
    sheet with the start and done icons. Be aware that icons and their corresponding actions are optional, so not every step might provide one.</p>
