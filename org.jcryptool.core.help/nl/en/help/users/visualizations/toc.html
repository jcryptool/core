	<h1>Visualizations</h1>

	<p>The JCT main menu <strong>Visuals</strong> (in the Default Perspective) has more than 30 entries. Each visualization explains in an extensive and graphical way how a cryptographic algorithm or protocol works. This is the part of JCT where most of the work went in (as these visuals were built from scratch, while pure algorithms often were available before).</p>

	<p>To construct visualizations a didactical concept has to be made and details of the algorithm have to be revealed. These details normally are not outputed if you only perform the algorithm and therefore only interested in the algorithm's result. The graphics are often inspired from the original papers or from the material of contributing lecturers.</p>

	<p>The visualized algorithms can be clustered into different categories explaining</p>
	<ul>
        <li>classic ciphers and their cryptanalysis &ndash;  like Grille, ACO, </li>
        <li>modern symmetric ciphers &ndash;  like LFSR, ARC4/Spritz, DES,</li>
        <li>modern Hashes &ndash;  like Hash sensitivity,</li>
        <li>modern asymmetric ciphers &ndash;  like (extended) RSA, ECC, Merkle-Hellman knapsack, ElGamal,</li>
        <li>public-key infrastructures with components &ndash;  like certificate verification, signature demonstration, signature verification,</li>
        <li>basic concepts &ndash;  like CRT, extended Euclid, calculating a discret logarithm using Shanks babystep-giantstep, zero-knowledge proofs, password methods like AUP,</li>
        <li>basic protocols &ndash;  like DH key exchange, Shamir secret sharing, verifiable secret sharing,</li>
        <li>modern protocols &ndash;  like SSL handshake, multipartite key exchange, homomorphic encryption,</li>
        <li>attack mechanisms on modern ciphers &ndash;  like kleptography, simple power analysis,</li>
        <li>PQC methods &ndash;  like McEliece (error-correcting code), multivariate cryptography (like Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar or Rainbow), Merkle signatures, WOTS/WOTS+, SPHINCS and SPHINCS+.</li>
    </ul>
