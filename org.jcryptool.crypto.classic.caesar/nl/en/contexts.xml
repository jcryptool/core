    <description>The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a classical type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
&lt;br&gt;The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals.
