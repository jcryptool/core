<h1>Caesar Cipher</h1>
<p>
	The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals.

<p>
	The Caesar cipher is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.

<h4>Encryption:</h4>

<p>At the Caesar cipher, every character of
the text is replaced by a character k positions far away in the alphabet. This
“shift“ k is the key, which is often not written as a number, but as a
character of the alphabet. The key k as a number is then the position of this
character in the alphabet (1-relative).</p>

<p>Since the Caesar cipher is a monoalphabetic
substitution, it can also be described with a substitution alphabet. This
substitution alphabet is of course just rotated by k. An example will describe
it best - For k = 4 (and the standard Latin uppercase alphabet):</p>

<p>Every character in the plain text is substituted
by the character which is at the same position in the cipher text alphabet. </p>

<p>Example of an encryption:</p>

<p><i>Plain text:</i> “CHIFFRE”;
key: “D” (means k=4)</p>

<p><i>Encryption result:</i> „GLMJJVI“ (C+4 = <b>G</b>, H+4 = <b>L</b>, …; substitution alphabet
example from above fits, too)</p>


<h4>Decryption:</h4>

<p>The decryption is done naturally by
shifting the characters back up the alphabet by the amount k. Systematically, an
inverse key i to k is created, with i = length(Alphabet) – k, and for
decryption, the cipher text is “encrypted” with i.</p>
