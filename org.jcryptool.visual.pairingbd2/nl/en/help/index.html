  <h2 id="scheme-general">1) Multi-Partite Key Exchange (MPKE) Algorithms</h2>
  
  <p>Multi-party or multi-partite key agreement (MPKA) [other names used in literature are group key exchange (<b>GKE</b>) protocol or conference key establishment protocol] are methods to exchange information over unsecure/public channels in order to agree on a secure common cryptographic key (sometimes called session key) between more than 2 parties. The first scheme of this kind was the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.visual.ecdh/$nl$/help/content/index.html">Diffie-Hellman key exchange (<b>DH</b>)</a> which described this protocol for 2 parties.</p>
  
  <p>Multi-partite key agreement protocols are part of the research area of secure multi-party computation (<b>MPC</b>) and these protocols are relevant e.g. for video broadcasting, video conferencing (e.g. in Riot or Jitsi), mobile phones, or 3G, 4G, or 5G.</p>
  
  <p>Here we consider only such multi-partite key agreement protocols which do not require any trusted third party. The original Diffie-Hellman key exchange (DHKE) was originally implemented only in finite fields of prime order. However, also other cryptographic "settings" can be used namely elliptic curves and pairings on elliptic curves.</p>
  
  <p>This visualization shows for an arbitrary number of users the <b>BD II</b> key exchange protocol (named after its inventors <b>B</b>urmester and <b>D</b>esmedt), presented in the pairings from Weil and Tate for a degree k=2 and in pairings for a degree k=12. More details can be found in [Onete 2008].</p>




<br/>  
  <h2 id="plugin">2) Handling Instructions: How to Use this Visualization</h2>

  <p> The broadcast BD II algorithm in the pairing setting uses the elliptic curve E set by default to use the short Weierstrass equation y^2 = x^3 + 3. The according users' arrangement is shown in the <b>Protocol illustration</b> grouping: Given an initial triangle of 3 users, all users then have up to 4 children, exactly 1 parent, and 0 or 1 sibling. If you increment the spinner for the number of users and watch the protocol illustration, you can see how new users are arranged in this graph.</p>

  <p> After starting the MPKE visualization you can select the pre-setting parameters for the MPKE operation using:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Number n of users to participate (3 < n < 101)</li>
   <li>Embedding degree k (2 or 12)</li>
</ul>

  <p> For the embedding degree k=2 you have further options:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Level of security (pen&paper or industrial security)</li>
   <li>Pairing type (Tate or Weil)</li>
</ul>


  <p> The default parameters (which you also get after clicking on the restart icon) are: n=4, k=12</p> 

  <p> Then on the left, you can see the real initial parameters the program uses according to your pre-settings. Currently, these initial parameters cannot be changed manually, only indirectly by selecting the pre-settings. </p> 

  <p> In the default case (k=12) these initial parameters are the public parameters: q, l, E, E', P on E and Q' on E'.</p> 

  <p> Within the <b>Protocol illustration</b> grouping, each user U_i with i=1, ..., n has to perform 4 steps:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Step 1: generate secret s=r_i</li>
   <li>Step 2: calculate public Q=Z_i=s*P 
               [or R_i=s*Q'] and broadcast them</li>
   <li>Step 3: users besides the leaves in the graph calculate an additional broadcast value X_i </li>
   <li>Step 4: each user calculates from his secret s and the received broadcast messages the common conference key</li>
</ul>

  <p> Step 5 is just for verification that all conference keys are equal (this step is only in the demonstration, it's not needed in reality).</p>

  <p> Below the <b>Protocol illustration</b> grouping is a grouping with used definitions and formulars. This grouping can be extracted and folded.</p>

  <p> Below that is the <b>Details</b> grouping where you can see the calculated values for each user. This grouping also can be extracted and folded.</p>

  <p> At the bottom is the <b>Logging</b> grouping: It shows the needed time and contains the button <b>Save results</b>. Clicking on this button generates a file with the default name JCT_BDII_Log.txt. This file contains all values (pre-settings, initial parameters, generated and calculated values of all steps). Before storing, you have to tell JCT where to store this file to.</p>
